# Opções de Ganchos

**1. Gancho de Texto na Tela:**

- Opção A: "Your website looks fine. That's why it's failing."

- Opção B: "Average website. Zero leads. Here's the real problem."

- Opção C: "Why your 'good enough' website isn't making you money."

**2. Gancho de Narração Direta:**

- Opção A: "Your B2B website is decent. And that's exactly why it's not working."

- Opção B: "Most founders invest in websites that look okay but convert nothing. Let me show you the real bottleneck."

- Opção C: "You have a functional website. So why isn't it bringing you qualified clients? Because 'functional' isn't enough anymore."

**3. Gancho Visual:**

- Opção A: Split screen showing a generic, template-looking website on the left side, and a completely empty CRM dashboard with zero leads on the right. Text overlay appears: "Average = Invisible"

- Opção B: Close-up of a founder staring at their laptop screen, frustrated expression. Camera zooms into the screen showing a decent website, then quickly cuts to Google Analytics showing zero conversions.

- Opção C: A hand scrolling through a standard B2B website on a tablet. The screen freezes and text appears: "Fine. Forgettable. Failing."

## Roteiro do Vídeo

### Cena 1 [00:00 - 00:08]

Split screen: Left side shows a generic, template-style B2B website. Right side shows an empty CRM dashboard with "0 Leads This Month" displayed. Text overlay: "Average = Invisible"

**Narração:**

*Your B2B website looks fine. That's exactly the problem. In a market of premium competitors, 'fine' doesn't stand out. It disappears.*

### Cena 2 [00:08 - 00:18]

Cut to a simple graphic animation showing three disconnected puzzle pieces labeled "Design," "Tech," and "Sales Strategy" floating separately, not connecting.

**Narração:**

*Most B2B founders invest in websites that look decent but fail strategically. The real bottleneck? Strategic Digital Dissonance — when your digital presence is fragmented instead of unified.*

### Cena 3 [00:18 - 00:28]

Visual of the three puzzle pieces now trying to connect but clashing, creating visual "error" effects. Then they snap together perfectly, forming a complete picture of a conversion funnel.

**Narração:**

*When design, tech, and sales strategy don't work as one system, your site becomes a forgettable brochure instead of a client-generating machine. You need extraordinary design AND conversion engineering. Not one or the other. Both.*

### Cena 4 [00:28 - 00:38]

Screen recording showing a before/after comparison: "Before" shows a generic contact form with no context. "After" shows a strategic lead capture system with clear value proposition, premium design, and automated follow-up sequence.

**Narração:**

*The fix isn't more traffic. It's a unified system where premium aesthetics and conversion strategy work together. Where your site doesn't just look professional — it performs like a sales machine.*

### Cena 5 [00:38 - 00:45]

Return to the narrator speaking directly to camera with confident, authentic energy. Behind them, a subtle visual of a dashboard showing increasing metrics.

**Narração:**

*I'm building my agency's conversion system from scratch — both the design AND the engine. Follow to see how I make my own business extraordinary.*

## Chamada para Ação (CTA) [00:45]

- **Opção A:** "Follow to watch me build this system in real-time for my own agency."

- **Opção B:** "Building this live. Follow to see the exact process and results."

- **Opção C:** "I'm documenting the entire build. Follow if you want the blueprint."

## Dicas

- **Keep the visual contrast sharp:** The split-screen comparison in the opening hook should show "generic/average" vs. "zero results" — NOT "beautiful vs zero results". The problem is mediocrity, not aesthetics.

- **Emphasize "fine = invisible":** The new positioning is that "good enough" gets ignored. Premium clients expect extraordinary.

- **Use the term "Strategic Digital Dissonance" as your hook concept:** It's specific, sounds authoritative, and creates curiosity.

- **Key message shift:** We're not saying "pretty doesn't sell" — we're saying "average is invisible" and "you need BOTH premium design AND conversion engineering."

- **The CTA leverages vulnerability as authority:** You're inviting them to watch you solve your own problem. This builds trust faster than any polished pitch.

- **End abruptly after the CTA:** No fade-outs, no "thanks for watching." Cut immediately after the final sentence.
