## Roteiro do Vídeo

### Cena 1 [00:00 - 00:08]

Split screen: Left side shows a sleek, professional B2B website. Right side shows an empty CRM dashboard with "0 Leads This Month" displayed. Text overlay: "Beautiful ≠ Profitable"

**Narração:**

*Your B2B website looks professional but generates zero leads. Here's why.*

### Cena 2 [00:08 - 00:18]

Cut to a simple graphic animation showing three disconnected puzzle pieces labeled "Design," "Tech," and "Sales Strategy" floating separately, not connecting.

**Narração:**

*Most B2B founders invest in beautiful websites that impress visually but fail strategically. The real bottleneck? Strategic Digital Dissonance.*

### Cena 3 [00:18 - 00:28]

Visual of the three puzzle pieces now trying to connect but clashing, creating visual "error" effects. Then they snap together perfectly, forming a complete picture of a conversion funnel.

**Narração:**

*When design, tech, and sales strategy don't speak the same language, your site becomes a pretty brochure instead of a client-generating machine.*

### Cena 4 [00:28 - 00:38]

Screen recording showing a before/after comparison: "Before" shows a generic contact form with no context. "After" shows a strategic lead capture system with clear value proposition and automated follow-up sequence.

**Narração:**

*The fix isn't a better designer or more traffic. It's a unified system where every element works in sync to convert visitors into qualified sales calls.*

### Cena 5 [00:38 - 00:45]

Return to the narrator speaking directly to camera with confident, authentic energy. Behind them, a subtle visual of a dashboard showing increasing metrics.

**Narração:**

*I'm building my agency's conversion system from scratch. Follow to see how I fix this for my own business first.*

## Chamada para Ação (CTA) [00:45]

- **Opção A:** "Follow to watch me build this system in real-time for my own agency."

- **Opção B:** "Building this live. Follow to see the exact process and results."

- **Opção C:** "I'm documenting the entire build. Follow if you want the blueprint."

## Dicas

- **Keep the visual contrast sharp:** The split-screen comparison in the opening hook is your strongest asset. Make sure the "beautiful website vs. empty results" contrast is visually obvious within the first 2 seconds.

- **Pace the narration faster than you think:** This is a 45-second video targeting B2B founders who are used to consuming information quickly. Your narration should feel urgent and information-dense, not leisurely.

- **Use the term "Strategic Digital Dissonance" as your hook concept:** It's specific, sounds authoritative, and creates curiosity. Don't over-explain it—let the visual of disconnected puzzle pieces do the work.

- **The CTA leverages vulnerability as authority:** You're not selling a finished product; you're inviting them to watch you solve your own problem. This builds trust faster than any polished pitch because it shows you're in the trenches with them.

- **End abruptly after the CTA:** No fade-outs, no "thanks for watching." The video should cut immediately after the final sentence to create a pattern interrupt and increase the likelihood of a follow.
