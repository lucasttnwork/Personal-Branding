# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 10

## Theme: "Why Your Site Came Back Looking Different Than the Design"
## Duration: 60 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "You approved a design. Then the developer 'interpreted' it."

- "Why your site looks nothing like what you approved"

- "The gap between design and code (it's costing you)"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "You approved a beautiful design. Then the developer 'interpreted' it. Sound familiar? Here's why 80% of projects have this problem."

- "Your designer made something gorgeous. Your developer built something... different. This is the gap that breaks most web projects."

- "Here's a story you probably know: approved a design, paid for development, got back something that looked 'close enough' but not quite right. That's not an accident. It's a systemic problem."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: Approved Figma design vs. actual coded result (slightly off)

- Animation: beautiful design file → developer shrugging → mediocre result

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Why your site came back looking different"

**Narration:**

*You approved a beautiful design. Then the developer "interpreted" it. Sound familiar? Here's why 80% of projects have this problem.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing Figma design alongside VS Code.

**Narration:**

*Day 10. Design phase is complete. Now comes the part where most projects fall apart: turning this design into actual code. The handoff between designer and developer. This is where beautiful designs become "close enough" sites.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:35]

Screen recording: You show the documented design specs — but framed as the PROBLEM that exists without them.

**Narration:**

*Here's what usually happens: Designer delivers a pretty picture. Developer asks "what's the spacing here?" Designer says "I don't know, like... medium?" Developer guesses. Multiply that by 100 decisions. You get a site that's technically the same design but feels off. The fonts are slightly different. The spacing is inconsistent. The buttons don't match. And you can't pinpoint why — it just doesn't feel premium anymore.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:35 - 00:48]

Screen recording: You briefly show the level of documentation required — specific values, exact colors, interaction notes.

**Narration:**

*This is why I handle both design AND development. No handoff. No "interpretation." No "close enough." The person who designed it builds it. Same vision, same attention to detail, pixel-perfect execution. When designer and developer are different people who don't communicate deeply, you pay for it in quality.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:48 - 01:00]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 11: Code that doesn't slow you down"

**Narration:**

*This is why premium matters at every step — not just design, not just code, the integration of both. Tomorrow: your slow site is costing you 7% of conversions for every second of delay. Link in bio if you want one team handling everything, not a game of telephone.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Has this happened to you? Approved a design, got back something "different"? That's the handoff problem. It's fixable — but only if you know it exists.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We don't do handoffs. Design and development under one roof, one vision, no compromises. That's the difference. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Experience):**

*Ever looked at your live site and thought "this isn't quite what I approved"? You're not imagining things. Follow to see how we solve it.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** Names an experience James has probably had — approving a design and getting something different.

2. **Relatable Story:** "Designer says 'like... medium?'" is humorous and painfully accurate for anyone who's gone through this.

3. **Integration Differentiator:** The key message is that separate designer/developer = compromise. One person = consistency.

4. **Not a Tutorial:** This is NOT teaching James how to do handoffs better. It's showing him why he needs someone who doesn't have this problem.

5. **Service CTA:** "One team handling everything, not a game of telephone" — clear service differentiation.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Design specs," "handoff documentation," "developer ready files," "component library"
   - USE: "Interpretation," "close enough," "pixel-perfect," "same vision"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
