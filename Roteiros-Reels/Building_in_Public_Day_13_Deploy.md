# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 13

## Theme: "A Beautiful Site Is Still Just a Brochure"
## Duration: 55 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "Congratulations. Your site is live. It's still just a brochure."

- "Beautiful site ≠ leads (here's what's missing)"

- "Your site is live. Now what?"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "Congratulations. Your site is live. It loads fast. It looks premium. And it's still just a digital brochure if it doesn't capture leads."

- "Your site is beautiful. Your site is fast. Your site is live. But if it's not generating leads automatically, it's just an expensive business card."

- "Here's the moment most businesses think they're done: the site goes live. But a live site without automation is like a storefront with no one at the register."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Beautiful site loading, then a "so what?" moment — empty inbox, no leads, no calls

- Brochure being printed vs. system working in background

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Your site is live. It's still just a brochure."

**Narration:**

*Congratulations. Your site is live. It loads fast. It looks premium. And it's still just a digital brochure if it doesn't capture leads.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing deploy command, then the live site loading.

**Narration:**

*Day 13. The site is live. Real URL. Real internet. Thirteen days of strategy, design, and development — all now accessible to the world. This is the moment most people celebrate. I'm not done yet.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:30]

Screen recording: Brief tour of the live site — it works, it's fast, it looks good.

**Narration:**

*Look at this. It works. It's fast. It's strategically designed to convert. But here's what most businesses get wrong: they stop here. They have a beautiful site that exists. But a site that exists isn't a system that generates. Without the automation layer, visitors come, maybe browse, and leave. You never know who they were. No capture. No follow-up. No system.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:30 - 00:42]

You look at camera with emphasis.

**Narration:**

*A brochure sits on a shelf and waits. A system works while you sleep. Every business owner I talk to wants the second one. Most of them have the first one. They paid for beautiful. They got static. Tomorrow I add what turns this site into an actual client acquisition machine.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:42 - 00:55]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 14: The system that works while you sleep"

**Narration:**

*Tomorrow: the final piece. Automation. Lead capture. Nurture sequences. The layer that turns a site into a system that generates leads on autopilot. Link in bio if you want a site that works FOR you, not just exists.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick question: is your site generating leads while you sleep? Or is it just sitting there looking pretty?*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We don't build brochures. We build systems that capture, nurture, and convert. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Anticipation):**

*Tomorrow is the finale. The automation layer that makes everything work on autopilot. Follow so you don't miss it.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** "Still just a brochure" immediately reframes what James might consider success (going live).

2. **Brochure vs. System:** This metaphor is introduced clearly and carries through the episode.

3. **Not Celebrating Yet:** The refusal to celebrate "going live" signals that there's something more James hasn't thought about.

4. **Tension Building:** This episode creates anticipation for Day 14 — the "missing piece" that most businesses don't have.

5. **Service CTA:** "Works FOR you, not just exists" — clear distinction between what James probably has and what he wants.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Deploy," "production environment," "CI/CD," "hosting configuration"
   - USE: "Live," "real internet," "captures leads," "works while you sleep"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
