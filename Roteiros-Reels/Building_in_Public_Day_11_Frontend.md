# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 11

## Theme: "Your Slow Site Is Costing You 7% Per Second"
## Duration: 65 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "Every second your site takes to load, you lose 7% of conversions"

- "Your slow site is costing you money (here's how much)"

- "Beautiful design. Terrible performance. Zero leads."

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "For every second your site takes to load, you lose 7% of conversions. If you're getting 100 visitors a day, how much is that costing you?"

- "Your site looks premium. But does it LOAD premium? Because a 5-second load time is losing you over 30% of potential customers."

- "Here's a number that should scare you: 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take more than 3 seconds to load. How fast is yours?"

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: beautiful site that loads slowly (loading spinner) vs. fast-loading site

- Lighthouse score showing poor performance (40-50) with annotations about money lost

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "7% lost per second of load time"

**Narration:**

*For every second your site takes to load, you lose 7% of conversions. If you're getting 100 visitors a day, how much is that costing you?*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing code being written with performance metrics visible.

**Narration:**

*Day 11 of building my acquisition system. Today I'm writing code. But I'm not just making it work — I'm making it fast. Because technical quality isn't a nice-to-have. It directly impacts how many visitors become leads.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:38]

Screen recording: You show performance-focused decisions being made — but framed as business outcomes, not technical process.

**Narration:**

*Here's what most businesses don't realize: your site speed IS a conversion factor. A page that loads in 1 second has 3x the conversion rate of one that takes 5 seconds. Same design. Same copy. Same offer. The only difference is how fast it loads. That's not a technical detail — that's money on the table. And most sites are built for "good enough" speed. Not performance-optimized speed.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:38 - 00:50]

Screen recording: You run a performance test showing 90+ score.

**Narration:**

*Let me show you something. Performance score: 92. Loads in under 2 seconds. This isn't accident — it's engineering. The same engineering I use for clients who understand that a slow site doesn't just feel amateur. It costs real revenue. Every. Single. Day.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:50 - 01:05]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 12: 60% of your prospects see THIS version first"

**Narration:**

*This is why development quality matters as much as design quality. A beautiful, slow site is still a revenue leak. Tomorrow: the version of your site that 60% of B2B decision-makers see first — and it's probably not the one you're proud of. Link in bio if you want a site that loads as premium as it looks.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Here's a test: go to Google PageSpeed Insights and enter your URL. If you're below 80 on mobile, you're losing visitors before they even see your offer.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We build for speed, not just appearance. Fast sites convert better. Period. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Stats):**

*7% conversion loss per second. That's not opinion — that's data. Follow to see how we build for performance.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** "How much is that costing you?" makes the technical problem a financial one.

2. **Stats-Driven:** Numbers (7%, 53%, 3x) make abstract "speed" into concrete business impact.

3. **Same Design, Different Outcome:** The key insight is that identical designs can have wildly different results based on technical execution.

4. **Not a Tutorial:** James isn't learning how to optimize sites — he's understanding why he needs someone who knows how.

5. **Service CTA:** "Loads as premium as it looks" — connects technical quality to the premium positioning James wants.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Lazy loading," "code splitting," "build optimization," "LCP," "TTFB"
   - USE: "Speed," "performance," "load time," "money on the table," "revenue leak"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
