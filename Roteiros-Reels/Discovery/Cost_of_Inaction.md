## Roteiro Completo (55 segundos)

### 🎬 QPV1 — HOOK [00:00-00:06]

🎦 *You at desk, serious expression. Maybe holding phone like you're about to show something.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "$60,000/year"

🗣 "Your amateur website is costing you sixty thousand dollars a year. And I'm not exaggerating. Let me show you the math."

🔊 *SFX: Calculator "beep" or cash register*

✂️ *Hard cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV2 — THE MATH (Part 1) [00:06-00:18]

🎦 *Screen recording or whiteboard/paper showing the calculation being written. You narrate over.*

🟨 **TEXT appears line by line:**
- "Average client value: $15,000"
- "Clients lost to bad positioning: 1/quarter"
- "Annual loss: $60,000"

🗣 "Here's how it works. Let's say your average client is worth fifteen thousand dollars. Pretty standard for B2B services, premium consulting, SaaS. Now — how many potential clients visit your site, don't feel the trust, and leave? Let's be conservative. ONE qualified prospect per quarter decides you're not the one. Just one."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV3 — THE MATH (Part 2) [00:18-00:28]

🎦 *Continue calculation. Numbers appearing on screen.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "1 client × 4 quarters × $15k = $60,000"

🗣 "One client per quarter. Times four quarters. Times fifteen thousand dollars. That's sixty thousand dollars a year you're not making — not because your service is bad, but because your digital presence doesn't communicate your value. And that's the CONSERVATIVE estimate."

🔊 *SFX: Subtle impact sound on "$60,000"*

✂️ *Jump cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV4 — THE TWIST [00:28-00:40]

🎦 *Back to you on camera. Leaning in, more intimate.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Invisible cost"

🗣 "Here's the worst part: you'll never see these clients. They won't send an email saying 'your website looked amateur so I went with your competitor.' They just... disappear. You'll never know they existed. So it doesn't feel like you're losing sixty grand. It just feels like 'business is slow.' But the math doesn't lie."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV5 — CTA [00:40-00:55]

🎦 *Direct to camera. Confident, solution-oriented.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Free diagnostic → Link in bio"

🗣 "Now here's the question: how much would you pay to stop that leak? Because I'll tell you — it's a lot less than sixty thousand dollars. Link in bio to get a free diagnostic. I'll show you exactly where your site is losing you money and what it would take to fix it."

🗣 *(Beat, direct)* "The cost of waiting? You already know the math."

✂️ *Hard cut*

## Conexão com Série

**Standalone:** Funciona 100% como peça de conversão isolada

**Follow-up:** "Limited Availability" post or direct DM outreach
**Retargeting:** Great for ads targeting warm audience

## Caption Sugerida (Instagram)

```
Let's do some uncomfortable math.

Your average client is worth $15,000.
(Conservative for B2B services, consulting, SaaS.)

Now — how many qualified prospects visit your site, don't feel the trust, and go with someone else?

Let's say just ONE per quarter.
Just one.

1 client × 4 quarters × $15,000 = $60,000/year

That's sixty thousand dollars you're not making.

Not because your service is bad.
Because your website doesn't communicate your value.

The worst part?
You'll never see these clients.

They won't email saying "your site looked amateur."
They just disappear.

It doesn't feel like losing $60k.
It just feels like "business is slow."

But the math doesn't lie.
