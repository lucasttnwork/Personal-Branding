## Opções de Hook

### Hook 1 — Contrarian (Recomendado)
**"Your website gets 10,000 visitors a month? Cool. How many demos did you book? Because that's the only number that matters."**

### Hook 2 — Provocativo
**"You're celebrating the wrong metric. Traffic means nothing if it doesn't convert to calls."**

### Hook 3 — Direto
**"Stop measuring traffic. Start measuring demos booked. Here's why."**

---

## Roteiro Completo (35 segundos)

### 🎬 QPV1 — HOOK [00:00-00:06]

🎦 *You at desk, slightly amused expression — "let me tell you something obvious that nobody talks about."*

🟨 **TEXT:** "The wrong metric"

🗣 "Your website gets ten thousand visitors a month? Cool. How many demos did you book? Because that's the only number that actually pays your bills."

🔊 *SFX: Cash register "cha-ching" on "pays your bills"*

✂️ *Hard cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV2 — O PROBLEMA [00:06-00:14]

🎦 *Gesturing, slightly animated.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Traffic = Vanity"

🗣 "I see this all the time. Business owners obsessing over Google Analytics. 'We got more traffic this month!' Great. But traffic is a vanity metric. It makes you feel good. It doesn't make you money."

✂️ *Jump cut on "doesn't make you money"*

---

### 🎬 QPV3 — O INSIGHT [00:14-00:22]

🎦 *Closer framing. Direct eye contact. This is the truth bomb.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Demos = Sanity"

🗣 "Here's what actually matters for high-ticket B2B: qualified demos booked. That's it. Not pageviews. Not time on site. Not bounce rate. Demos. Sales calls. Opportunities in your pipeline. Everything else is noise."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV4 — PRÉ-CTA [00:22-00:28]

🎦 *Slight lean back, reflective tone.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "What are YOU measuring?"

🗣 "So here's the question: is your site designed to get traffic? Or is it engineered to book calls? Because those are two very different machines."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV5 — CTA + LOOP [00:28-00:35]

🎦 *Same framing as hook. Creates loop.*

🗣 "If you don't know how many demos your site generated last month, that's a problem. Follow to see how I'm building a site that measures the only metric that matters."

🟨 **TEXT:** "Follow for the build ↗"

🗣 *(Callback, softer)* "Because traffic without conversion? That's just expensive entertainment."

✂️ *Hard cut — loops to beginning*

---

## Caption Sugerida (Instagram)

```
Your website gets 10,000 visitors a month?

Cool.

How many demos did you book?

Because that's the only number that actually pays your bills.

---

I see this all the time:
→ Business owners obsessing over Google Analytics
→ Celebrating "more traffic this month"
→ Ignoring the metric that actually matters

Traffic is a vanity metric.
It makes you feel good.
It doesn't make you money.

For high-ticket B2B, here's what actually matters:
✓ Qualified demos booked
✓ Sales calls scheduled
✓ Opportunities in your pipeline

Not pageviews.
Not time on site.
Not bounce rate.

---

So here's the question:

Is your site designed to get traffic?
Or engineered to book calls?

Because those are two very different machines.

## Framework de Métricas (Para Referência)

| Métrica | Tipo | Por que importa (ou não) |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| Traffic | Vanity | Feels good, means nothing alone |
| Pageviews | Vanity | More isn't better if they don't convert |
| Time on Site | Vanity | Could mean confusion, not engagement |
| Bounce Rate | Context | Depends on intent — not always bad |
| **Demos Booked** | **Sanity** | **Direct line to revenue** |
| **Calls Scheduled** | **Sanity** | **Pipeline opportunity** |
| **Revenue Generated** | **Reality** | **The only metric that pays bills** |
