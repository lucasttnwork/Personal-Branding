## Theme: "Colors Aren't Decoration. They're Sales Psychology."
## Duration: 65 seconds

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "You picked blue because you like blue. Bad reason."

- "Your colors are sending signals. Do you know which ones?"

- "Design psychology: why your brand colors might be hurting sales"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "You picked blue because you like blue. But does blue make your ideal client trust you? Here's what color psychology actually says."

- "Your website colors are communicating something. The question is: are they communicating what you WANT them to?"

- "Here's a question: why did you choose your brand colors? If the answer is 'I like them' or 'my designer suggested them,' you might be sending the wrong signals."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: same content with two different color schemes — one feels premium, one feels amateur

- Color palette with psychological annotations: "Blue = Trust," "Orange = Action," "Gray = Premium"

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Your colors are sending signals"

**Narration:**

*You picked blue because you like blue. But does blue make your ideal client trust you? Here's what color psychology actually says.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing Figma with the color palette being built.

**Narration:**

*Day 8 of building my acquisition system. Today: the visual layer. Colors, fonts, spacing. But here's what most people miss — I'm not choosing colors I like. I'm choosing colors that make my ideal client feel what they need to feel to say yes.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:38]

Screen recording: Color choices being made with annotations showing the reasoning.

- Primary (deep blue): "Trust, authority, stability — James runs a serious business, needs to feel he's dealing with someone established"
- Accent (warm color): "Action, human warmth — draws the eye to CTAs"
- Neutrals (sophisticated grays): "Premium, clean — signals high-end positioning"

**Narration:**

*Deep blue as primary. Not because I like it — because blue communicates trust and authority. James runs a serious business. He needs to feel like he's dealing with someone established, not a fly-by-night operation. Warm accent color for buttons and calls to action — it draws the eye and creates urgency. Sophisticated grays for balance — they signal premium positioning. Every color earns its place.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:38 - 00:50]

Screen recording: Before/after showing wireframe transforming with strategic colors applied.

**Narration:**

*Here's what happens when colors are chosen randomly: confusion. Your visitor's brain processes visual signals before reading a single word. If your colors say "cheap" or "chaotic" or "cold," they've already formed an impression. The wrong colors can undermine everything else you've built — the copy, the structure, the strategy. Colors aren't decoration. They're first impressions.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:50 - 01:05]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 9: The complete homepage reveal"

**Narration:**

*Same structure, same copy — but with strategic visual decisions applied, it communicates value before anyone reads a word. Tomorrow: the complete homepage reveal. Every section, every element working together. Link in bio if you want a site that looks premium AND converts premium.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick question: do you know what your brand colors communicate? If you chose them because you "liked them," they might be saying something you don't intend.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We design for psychology, not just aesthetics. Colors that build trust. Layouts that convert. Link in bio to see how we do it.*

**Option 3 (Anticipation):**

*The full design reveal is tomorrow. All the strategy, structure, and style coming together. Follow so you don't miss it.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** Challenges a decision James probably made casually — choosing colors by preference.

2. **Psychology Frame:** "Colors that make my ideal client feel what they need to feel" — framed as business psychology, not design theory.

3. **Strategic Reasoning:** Each color choice comes with a business reason, not aesthetic preference.

4. **Visual Transformation:** The before/after moment shows the impact of strategic color application.

5. **Service CTA:** "Looks premium AND converts premium" — combines aesthetic and business outcomes.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Color theory," "visual hierarchy principles," "design system documentation"
   - USE: "Color psychology," "first impressions," "what they feel," "signals"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
