# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 4

## Theme: "You Have Testimonials. They're in the Wrong Place."
## Duration: 60 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "You added testimonials. Great. They're in the wrong place."

- "Your social proof is wasted (here's why)"

- "Testimonials at the bottom? No one gets there."

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "You added testimonials to your site. Great. But are they placed where skepticism peaks? Or just at the bottom where no one scrolls?"

- "You have social proof. You have case studies. You might even have impressive logos. But if they're not appearing at the exact moment your visitor needs them, they're just decoration."

- "Here's why your testimonials aren't working: they're answering a question your visitor asked 30 seconds ago — when they've already moved on."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: Website with testimonials buried at the bottom vs. same testimonials placed strategically mid-page

- Heat map showing most visitors never scroll to the testimonials section

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Your testimonials are in the wrong place"

**Narration:**

*You added testimonials to your site. Great. But are they placed where skepticism peaks? Or just at the bottom where no one scrolls?*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing Miro board with conversion triggers being mapped.

**Narration:**

*Day 4 of building my acquisition system. Today I'm deciding exactly where every trust element goes. Not "somewhere on the page" — exactly where the visitor needs it. Because placement is everything.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:35]

Screen recording showing strategic placement decisions, framed as insights.

Visible elements:
- "Client logos → Above the fold (immediate credibility)"
- "Testimonials → After pricing (handles 'is this worth it?' objection)"
- "Case study → Mid-page (builds trust during consideration)"
- "Guarantee → Right after price reveal (neutralizes anxiety)"

**Narration:**

*Here's what most businesses miss: testimonials aren't just "proof you're good." They're objection neutralizers. And every objection has a moment. When your visitor sees your pricing, their brain immediately fires: "Is this worth it?" THAT'S when they need to see someone saying "best investment I've made." Not at the bottom after they've already decided you're too expensive.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:35 - 00:48]

Screen recording: You draw connections between visitor emotions and proof placement.

**Narration:**

*Most sites have all the right elements — testimonials, logos, guarantees — scattered randomly. "Just put them somewhere." That's leaving conversions on the table. Strategic placement means the right proof hits at the right moment. It feels like you're reading their mind. Because, in a way, you are.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:48 - 01:00]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 5: What this strategic work actually looks like"

**Narration:**

*This is conversion architecture, not decoration. Tomorrow: I'll show you the complete strategic blueprint — four days of research before a single pixel of design. This is what we build for clients before we touch Figma. Link in bio if you want to see what this looks like for your business.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick audit: where are your testimonials right now? Right after pricing? Or buried at the bottom? That placement alone might be costing you deals.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We position every trust element to hit at the exact moment of maximum skepticism. That's the difference between a site and a system. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Engagement):**

*Tell me in the comments: where are your testimonials on your site? I'll tell you if they're working for you or against you.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** Directly challenges something James probably thinks he's already done right.

2. **"You Have It, But..." Frame:** Validates that James has done the work (added testimonials) while showing he's missing the strategic layer.

3. **Placement = Strategy:** The key insight is that WHERE things go matters more than WHETHER they exist.

4. **Concrete Examples:** Specific placements (after pricing, mid-page) give James actionable mental frameworks.

5. **Service CTA:** "Link in bio if you want to see what this looks like for your business" — not teaching him to do it himself.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Conversion triggers," "strategic element placement," "social proof framework"
   - USE: "Trust elements," "testimonials," "when they need to see it," "reading their mind"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
