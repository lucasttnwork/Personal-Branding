# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 6

## Theme: "Why Your 'Pretty' Site Doesn't Convert"
## Duration: 65 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "Your designer made something beautiful. But did they do THIS first?"

- "Pretty design ≠ conversions (here's the missing piece)"

- "The hidden reason your expensive site doesn't generate leads"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "Your designer made something beautiful. Did they map how your visitor's eye should travel? Or did they just make it look good?"

- "You paid thousands for a beautiful website. It's not converting. Here's probably why: they started with design, not structure."

- "Here's a question: can you explain why each section of your site is where it is? Or does it just 'look nice'?"

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: beautiful but random website layout vs. same content with strategic structure

- Animation showing "eye path" on a poorly structured site (chaos) vs. strategically structured site (clear flow)

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "The hidden reason your site doesn't convert"

**Narration:**

*Your designer made something beautiful. Did they map how your visitor's eye should travel? Or did they just make it look good?*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing Figma being opened with the Miro blueprint visible on second monitor.

**Narration:**

*Day 6. Today I open the design tool for the first time. But I'm not picking colors or fonts yet. I'm building what most designers skip: the structural blueprint. The skeleton that determines whether visitors actually convert — or just admire your site and leave.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:38]

Screen recording: Simple boxes being arranged in Figma. Hero → Problem → Solution → Proof → Pricing → CTA.

**Narration:**

*Watch what I'm doing. Just boxes. No colors. No images. Because before making it polished, I need to know: does the information flow in the right order? Hero section answers "Is this for me?" Problem section validates their frustration. Solution shows the path forward. Proof builds trust. Pricing comes AFTER value is established — not before. Most generic sites get this order wrong. They look fine but the information is scattered. The visitor's brain works harder. And when brains work harder, they leave.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:38 - 00:50]

Screen recording: You annotate the boxes with journey stage labels.

**Narration:**

*This is why expensive redesigns fail. The site looks fine. But the structure was never engineered for conversion. So you get "nice website" — but no leads. Fine doesn't close deals. Structure that guides visitors from curious to convinced? That does.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:50 - 01:05]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 7: The words that actually sell"

**Narration:**

*Design without structure is decoration. Tomorrow: the copy that fills this structure — words engineered to convert, not just sound good. This is what separates a $500 template site from a $30k client acquisition system. Link in bio if you want the system, not the template.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick test: look at your current site. Can you explain WHY the hero section is followed by what's below it? If it's "because the designer said so," you might have a structure problem.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*Beautiful design is easy to find. Strategic structure that converts? That's what we build. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Contrast):**

*Template sites look fine. They don't convert. Engineered structures do. That's the difference. Follow for more.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** Challenges something James already paid for (beautiful design) without insulting his choice.

2. **"Before Pretty" Frame:** Establishes that there's a layer BEFORE aesthetics that most miss.

3. **Simple Visual = Powerful Point:** The boxes-only approach visually demonstrates that strategy comes before style.

4. **Compliment Trap:** "You get compliments but no leads" is a relatable experience for James.

5. **Service CTA:** "$500 template vs. $30k system" creates clear category differentiation.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Wireframe," "low-fidelity," "information architecture," "user flow"
   - USE: "Structure," "skeleton," "how information flows," "guides visitors"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
