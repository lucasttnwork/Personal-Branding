# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 9

## Theme: "Every Element Has a Job. Does Yours?"
## Duration: 70 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "This button is here for a reason. Is yours?"

- "Every element has a job. Can you name what each section on YOUR site does?"

- "Random sections = random results"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "This button is here for a reason. This testimonial is placed at this exact moment for a reason. Can you say the same about your site?"

- "Every section on your site should have a job. A specific psychological purpose. If you can't name what each section does, it's probably just decoration."

- "Here's a question: why is your about section where it is? If the answer is 'that's where about sections go,' you might have a random site, not a strategic one."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Complete homepage scroll with annotations appearing: "Job: Stop the scroll" → "Job: Validate pain" → "Job: Build trust" → "Job: Overcome objection"

- Split screen: random site layout vs. strategic site with purpose labels

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Every element has a job. Does yours?"

**Narration:**

*This button is here for a reason. This testimonial is placed at this exact moment for a reason. Can you say the same about your site?*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing the complete homepage in Figma.

**Narration:**

*Day 9. The complete homepage is done. Nine days of work. And here's what makes this different from most sites: I can explain exactly why every single element is where it is. Not "it looks good there." A specific, strategic reason.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:40]

Screen recording: Slow scroll through the homepage with annotations appearing as you pass each section.

- Hero: "Job: Stop scroll, name the pain in 3 seconds"
- Social proof bar: "Job: Instant credibility before reading continues"
- Problem section: "Job: Validate frustration, create 'yes, that's me' moment"
- Solution section: "Job: Show path forward, build hope"
- Methodology: "Job: Demonstrate competence, not vibes"
- Case study: "Job: Prove it works for people like them"
- Pricing: "Job: Present investment after value is established"
- Testimonials: "Job: Neutralize 'is it worth it?' objection"
- FAQ/CTA: "Job: Handle remaining concerns, capture action"

**Narration:**

*Hero section: stop the scroll and name the pain in 3 seconds. Social proof bar: instant credibility before they read another word. Problem section: make them think "yes, that's exactly me." Solution: show the path forward. Methodology: prove I have a structured approach, not just vibes. Case study: demonstrate it works for people like them. Pricing: presented AFTER value is clear. Testimonials: right after pricing when the "is it worth it?" objection fires. Final CTA: capture anyone ready to act.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:40 - 00:55]

You zoom out to show the full page, then briefly show a competitor's random layout for contrast.

**Narration:**

*Most sites are collections of sections thrown together. "Every site has a hero, so we have a hero. Every site has testimonials, so we have testimonials." But no one asked: what JOB does this section do? That's why those sites don't convert. They're not systems. They're scrapbooks.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:55 - 01:10]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 10: Design is done. Now we build."

**Narration:**

*This is what a client acquisition system looks like: every element earning its place. Tomorrow: we start building. Design becomes code. The page comes to life. Link in bio if you want a site where nothing is random and everything converts.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Here's a challenge: open your site and try to name the JOB of each section. If you can't, those sections might be costing you conversions.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*Random sites get random results. Strategic systems convert. That's what we build. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Milestone):**

*Design phase complete. Nine days of strategic work before a line of code. Tomorrow the build begins. Follow to watch.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** "Can you say the same about your site?" — challenges James to audit his own situation.

2. **Job Framework:** Every section is named by its JOB, not its category. This creates a mental framework for James to evaluate his own site.

3. **Rapid Annotation:** The scroll-through with annotations is fast but clear — shows density of thinking without being a tutorial.

4. **Scrapbook vs. System:** The "scrapbook" analogy is memorable and slightly uncomfortable for James who probably has a "scrapbook" site.

5. **Service CTA:** "Nothing is random and everything converts" — clear promise without hyperbole.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Synchronous Conversion Architecture," "information architecture," "UI/UX best practices"
   - USE: "Job," "purpose," "strategic reason," "earning its place"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
