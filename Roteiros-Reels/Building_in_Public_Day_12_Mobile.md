# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 12

## Theme: "60% of Your B2B Prospects See THIS First"
## Duration: 60 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "Your ideal client is a CEO. She's on her phone."

- "60% of B2B decision-makers browse on mobile first"

- "What does YOUR site look like on an iPhone?"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "Your ideal client is a CEO. You think she's on desktop? She's browsing LinkedIn on her phone. Between meetings. In traffic. What does YOUR site look like there?"

- "Here's a stat that surprises most B2B businesses: 60% of executives browse on mobile first. That means most of your high-value prospects are seeing a version of your site you've probably never tested."

- "You built your site on a big monitor. Your ideal client is seeing it on a 6-inch screen. Are they seeing the same thing?"

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: beautiful desktop site vs. cramped/broken mobile version

- CEO holding phone in elevator, frustrated face, site doesn't work

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "60% of B2B executives browse on mobile first"

**Narration:**

*Your ideal client is a CEO. You think she's on desktop? She's browsing LinkedIn on her phone. Between meetings. What does YOUR site look like there?*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing mobile responsive testing.

**Narration:**

*Day 12 of building my acquisition system. Desktop version is done. Now comes the version that most of my high-value prospects will actually see first: mobile. And "responsive" isn't good enough.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:35]

Screen recording: Mobile testing on different devices, showing the EXPERIENCE not the technical adjustments.

**Narration:**

*Here's what most businesses miss: "responsive" just means it doesn't break on mobile. It doesn't mean it's good. Imagine James — 45, runs a SaaS, stuck in traffic, saw my LinkedIn post, clicked through on his iPhone. He has 30 seconds of attention. If my mobile site makes him pinch-to-zoom, scroll sideways, or squint at tiny text, I've lost him. Not because my offer is bad — because the experience is.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:35 - 00:48]

Screen recording: You scroll through the optimized mobile version — smooth, fast, easy to read.

**Narration:**

*This is mobile-optimized. Not "doesn't break." Actually designed for thumb navigation. Fast loading on cellular. Text readable without zooming. Buttons big enough to tap. The mobile experience IS the first impression for most of your best prospects. If it's bad, they don't switch to desktop. They just leave.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:48 - 01:00]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 13: It's live. But it's not done."

**Narration:**

*Tomorrow: the site goes live. But a beautiful, fast site is still just a digital brochure without what comes next. Link in bio if you want a site that works perfectly on every device your prospects use.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Here's a test: pull up your site on your phone right now. Scroll through it like a potential client would. Would you stay? Or would you leave?*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We build for every screen your prospects use. Desktop. Tablet. Mobile. Same premium experience everywhere. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Stats):**

*60% of B2B executives browse on mobile first. If your mobile experience is "good enough," you're losing deals before they start. Follow for more.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** "She's on her phone" — challenges the assumption that B2B = desktop.

2. **James Scenario:** Putting James in a specific situation (stuck in traffic, 30 seconds) makes it concrete.

3. **Responsive vs. Optimized:** The key distinction is that "doesn't break" isn't the same as "actually good."

4. **Experience Language:** Focus on what James EXPERIENCES (pinch-zoom, squinting) not technical terms.

5. **Service CTA:** "Works perfectly on every device" — outcome-focused promise.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Breakpoints," "viewport," "responsive design," "CSS media queries"
   - USE: "Mobile experience," "thumb navigation," "readable," "fast on cellular"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
