# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 5

## Theme: "This Blueprint Took 5 Days. Skipping It Will Cost You 5 Months."
## Duration: 55 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "5 days of strategy. 0 pixels designed. Here's why."

- "Skip this work = spend months fixing a broken site"

- "This is why your last website project went sideways"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "Most business owners skip this phase entirely. Then they spend 6 months wondering why their expensive new site doesn't generate leads."

- "You've probably done this: hired a designer, picked some colors, launched a site. Six months later, still no leads. This is the step you skipped."

- "Five days of work. Zero design. Zero code. But I now know exactly what this site needs to do. Most businesses never have this clarity — and it shows."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Drone-style zoom out: tiny detail → massive strategic board filled with weeks of work

- Time-lapse: Day 1 empty board → Day 5 complete blueprint in 10 seconds

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "5 days of work. 0 pixels designed."

**Narration:**

*Most business owners skip this phase entirely. Then they spend 6 months wondering why their expensive new site doesn't generate leads.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Full zoom out of the complete Miro board. All sections visible. You slowly navigate through it.

**Narration:**

*Day 5. Five days of strategic work before touching design. Look at this: who we're building for, what they're thinking at every moment, where every trust element goes, how objections get neutralized. This is the foundation most sites never have.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:32]

Navigate through key sections: ICP, journey map, conversion triggers.

**Narration:**

*Every business owner I've worked with has said the same thing: "I wish we'd done this before our last site." Because when you skip this — when you jump straight to "make it look good" — you're guessing. And guessing costs real money. Redesigns. Rewrites. Months of "why isn't this working?" This work takes 5 days. Fixing a site built without it? 5 months. Sometimes longer.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:32 - 00:42]

You add a final post-it: "Foundation Complete. Strategy locked."

**Narration:**

*Here's the thing: this isn't optional. It's the difference between a site that converts and an expensive digital brochure. The designer you hired didn't do this work. The developer definitely didn't. That's why it didn't work.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:42 - 00:55]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 6: Now we design (with a roadmap)"

**Narration:**

*Tomorrow starts the design phase. But with this blueprint, nothing is a guess. Every color, every word, every section already has a strategic reason to exist. This is what we do for clients before we open Figma. Link in bio if you want this clarity for your business.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick question: before your last site was designed, did you have this level of strategic clarity? If not, that might explain the results.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*This is what you're getting when you work with us: strategic clarity before a single pixel is designed. Not templates. Not guessing. Strategy first. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Milestone):**

*Foundation phase complete. Tomorrow we start designing — but with a roadmap, not a prayer. Follow to watch the build.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** Names the exact experience James has had — "expensive site, no leads."

2. **Validation:** "Every business owner I've worked with has said the same thing" — James isn't alone, and people like him hire this guy.

3. **Time Contrast:** "5 days vs. 5 months" creates a clear value proposition without stating price.

4. **Blame Shift (Gentle):** "The designer you hired didn't do this work" — it's not James's fault, but now he knows what was missing.

5. **Service CTA:** "This is what we do for clients before we open Figma" positions this as something you BUY, not something you learn.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Foundation phase," "F.O.C.O. method step 1," "strategic blueprint process"
   - USE: "Strategic work," "clarity," "roadmap," "knowing exactly what your site needs to do"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
