## Roteiro Completo (40 segundos)

### 🎬 QPV1 — HOOK [00:00-00:06]

🎦 *You at desk, calm confidence. Not salesy — explanatory.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "2 spots. Here's why."

🗣 "I'm opening two client spots this month. Just two. And here's why that number isn't arbitrary — it's actually the key to why this works."

✂️ *Hard cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV2 — A RAZÃO [00:06-00:16]

🎦 *Slight lean forward, explaining mode.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Quality requires focus"

🗣 "The system I build isn't a template I hand off. It's a complete acquisition architecture — strategy, design, development, automation. That takes deep focus. And deep focus means I can only work with two businesses at a time without compromising the result."

✂️ *Jump cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV3 — O BENEFÍCIO [00:16-00:26]

🎦 *Direct to camera, emphasizing the value.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Your project gets 100%"

🗣 "Here's what that means for you: when you're one of those two, you're not competing for attention with ten other projects. You get my full strategic brain on your business. Not a junior. Not a template. The same level of thinking I showed in the entire Building in Public series — applied to YOUR acquisition system."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV4 — PROVA SOCIAL IMPLÍCITA [00:26-00:33]

🎦 *Relaxed, matter-of-fact tone.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Not for everyone"

🗣 "Now — this isn't for everyone. If you need something cheap and fast, I'm not your guy. But if you're running a premium business and you're ready to invest in a system that actually generates clients? One of those two spots might be for you."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV5 — CTA [00:33-00:40]

🎦 *Direct, confident, clear next step.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Link in bio → Apply"

🗣 "Link in bio to apply for a free diagnostic. We'll look at your current digital presence, I'll tell you exactly what's broken, and if we're a fit — we talk about working together."

🗣 *(Beat)* "Two spots. First qualified, first served."

✂️ *Hard cut*

## Caption Sugerida (Instagram)

```
I'm opening 2 client spots this month.

Just 2.

Here's why that number isn't arbitrary:

The system I build isn't a template I hand off.

It's complete acquisition architecture:
→ Strategy
→ Design  
→ Development
→ Automation

That takes deep focus.

And deep focus means I can only work with 2 businesses at a time without compromising the result.

---

What that means for you:

When you're one of those 2, you're not competing for attention with 10 other projects.

You get my full strategic brain on YOUR business.

Not a junior.
Not a template.
The same level of thinking I showed in the Building in Public series — applied to your acquisition system.

---

This isn't for everyone.

If you need something cheap and fast? I'm not your guy.

But if you're running a premium business and you're ready to invest in a system that actually generates clients?

One of those 2 spots might be for you.

First qualified, first served.
