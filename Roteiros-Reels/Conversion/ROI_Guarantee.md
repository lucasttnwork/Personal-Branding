## Opções de Hook

### Hook 1 — Curiosidade (Recomendado)
**"I offer a 90-day performance guarantee. If your system doesn't generate more qualified leads, you get your money back. Here's why I can do that — and why most agencies can't."**

### Hook 2 — Provocativo
**"Most agencies won't guarantee results. I do. And the reason says everything about how we work differently."**

### Hook 3 — Direto
**"90 days. More qualified leads. Or your money back. Let me explain why that's not a crazy promise."**

## Roteiro Completo (55 segundos)

### 🎬 QPV1 — HOOK [00:00-00:08]

🎦 *You at desk, confident but not arrogant. "Let me explain something important" energy.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "90-Day Guarantee"

🗣 "I offer a 90-day performance guarantee. If your new system doesn't generate more qualified leads and you don't feel a clear improvement in brand perception — you get your money back. Here's why I can make that promise."

✂️ *Hard cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV2 — POR QUE OUTROS NÃO PODEM [00:08-00:20]

🎦 *Slightly animated, explaining the industry problem.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Why most agencies CAN'T"

🗣 "Most agencies can't offer this because they don't control the outcome. Think about it: they hand you a design, someone else builds it, a third person runs the marketing. If it doesn't work, everyone points fingers. 'The design was fine, the development broke it.' 'The site was fine, the traffic was bad.' No one owns the result."

✂️ *Jump cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV3 — POR QUE EU POSSO [00:20-00:32]

🎦 *Direct to camera, this is the differentiation.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Why I CAN"

🗣 "I can guarantee results because I control the entire system. Strategy, design, development, automation — one unified vision. No handoffs. No finger-pointing. If it doesn't work, there's only one person responsible: me. And that's exactly how it should be. When you own the whole process, you can own the outcome."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV4 — O QUE ISSO SIGNIFICA [00:32-00:45]

🎦 *Leaning in, more intimate.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Risk reversal"

🗣 "Here's what this means for you: the risk isn't on your shoulders anymore. You've probably been burned before — paid for a site that didn't deliver, worked with people who disappeared after launch. I get it. The guarantee exists because I've seen what bad experiences do to business owners. And I want you to know: if I don't deliver, I don't deserve your money."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV5 — CTA [00:45-00:55]

🎦 *Direct, confident close.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Link in bio → Free diagnostic"

🗣 "So if you're ready to build a real acquisition system — with someone who actually guarantees the result — link in bio for a free diagnostic. We'll look at what you have, I'll tell you what it would take, and you can decide if this is the right fit."

🗣 *(Beat)* "90 days. More leads. Or your money back. That's the deal."

✂️ *Hard cut*

### CTA 3 — Direto
**"Ready to work with someone who actually guarantees results? Link in bio."**

### CTA 4 — Objeção
**"Still skeptical? Good. You should be. Link in bio — let's talk about your specific situation."**

## Notas de Produção

### Tom de Entrega
- **NÃO:** Defensivo, over-promising, "trust me bro"
- **SIM:** Confiante, lógico, empático com experiências ruins passadas
- A garantia deve parecer consequência natural da metodologia, não tática de venda

### Sequência Ideal

2. Building in Public (demonstração)
3. Cost of Inaction (urgência)
4. **ROI Guarantee (neutraliza risco)**
5. Limited Availability (escassez)

### Objeções que Este Roteiro Neutraliza
- "E se não funcionar?"
- "Já fui enganado antes"
- "Agências nunca entregam o que prometem"
- "Como sei que você é diferente?"

### Tempo Estimado

- Edição: 20-25 min
- **Total: ~45 min**

## Caption Sugerida (Instagram)

```
I offer a 90-day performance guarantee.

If your new system doesn't generate more qualified leads and you don't feel a clear improvement in brand perception — you get your money back.

Here's why I can make that promise (and most agencies can't):

---

Most agencies can't guarantee results because they don't control the outcome.

Think about it:
→ They hand you a design
→ Someone else builds it
→ A third person runs the marketing

If it doesn't work? Everyone points fingers.

"The design was fine, the development broke it."
"The site was fine, the traffic was bad."

No one owns the result.

---

I can guarantee results because I control the entire system.

Strategy. Design. Development. Automation.
One unified vision. No handoffs. No finger-pointing.

If it doesn't work, there's only one person responsible: me.

And that's exactly how it should be.

When you own the whole process, you can own the outcome.

---

You've probably been burned before.
Paid for a site that didn't deliver.
Worked with people who disappeared after launch.

I get it.

The guarantee exists because if I don't deliver, I don't deserve your money.

Link in bio → Free diagnostic.

90 days. More leads. Or your money back.
