## Opções de Hook

### Hook 1 — Resultado Direto (Recomendado)
**"12 demos a month. That's what this SaaS founder was getting before we rebuilt his digital presence. 60 days later? Over 40. Here's what changed."**

### Hook 2 — Provocativo
**"Same product. Same market. Same ad spend. Triple the demos. The only thing that changed was the system we built."**

### Hook 3 — Curiosidade
**"This founder thought his product was the problem. It wasn't. His website was actively repelling qualified buyers. Here's the fix."**

## Roteiro Completo (50 segundos)

### 🎬 QPV1 — HOOK [00:00-00:07]

🎦 *You at desk, "let me show you something real" energy.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "12 → 40+ demos in 60 days"

🗣 "Twelve demos a month. That's what this SaaS founder was getting before we rebuilt his digital presence. Sixty days later? Over forty. Same product. Same market. Here's what actually changed."

🔊 *SFX: Subtle "ding" on "over forty"*

✂️ *Hard cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV2 — O PROBLEMA (Before) [00:07-00:18]

🎦 *Describing the situation, slight empathy in tone.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "The problem wasn't the product"

🗣 "His dashboard was functional. His product was solid. But the website? It looked like a template. Generic messaging. 'We help businesses grow.' Nothing that made a qualified buyer think 'this is built for me.' He was getting traffic — but visitors would land, scroll for ten seconds, and leave. The site was technically fine. Strategically? It was invisible."

✂️ *Jump cut on "invisible"*

---

### 🎬 QPV3 — A TRANSFORMAÇÃO (What We Did) [00:18-00:30]

🎦 *More animated, showing the solution.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "The fix: Strategic rebuild"

🗣 "What did we do? Full strategic rebuild. First: defined exactly who his ideal client was — not 'businesses', but specific founders with specific problems. Then: rewrote every word of copy to speak directly to that person. Restructured the page flow so every section answered an objection at exactly the right moment. And added automation so leads got nurtured automatically, not when he remembered to check his inbox."

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV4 — O RESULTADO (After) [00:30-00:42]

🎦 *Direct to camera, delivering the proof.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Results: 3x demos, same spend"

🗣 "The result? Demos tripled in sixty days. Same ad budget. Same product. The only thing that changed was the system that converted visitors into calls. And here's the kicker — his sales team said the leads were more qualified. People were showing up to demos already understanding the value. That's what strategic positioning does."

🔊 *SFX: Subtle impact on "tripled"*

✂️ *Cut*

---

### 🎬 QPV5 — CTA [00:42-00:50]

🎦 *Direct, confident close.*

🟨 **TEXT:** "Want results like this? Link in bio"

🗣 "This is what's possible when your digital presence is engineered for conversion, not just designed to look good. Link in bio if you want to see what this kind of transformation would look like for your business."

🗣 *(Beat)* "Because your product probably isn't the problem. Your system might be."

✂️ *Hard cut*

---

## Opções de CTA Final

### CTA 1 — Diagnóstico (Recomendado)
**"Link in bio to see what this transformation would look like for your business."**

### CTA 2 — Identificação

### CTA 3 — Provocativo
**"Your product probably isn't the problem. Your system might be. Link in bio to find out."**

### CTA 4 — Resultado
**"Same product. Triple the demos. That's the power of strategic positioning. Link in bio."**

## Notas de Produção

### Tom de Entrega
- **NÃO:** Bragging, exagerado, "we're amazing"
- **SIM:** Factual, storytelling, mostrando o processo
- O foco deve ser na TRANSFORMAÇÃO do cliente, não em você

### Opções Visuais
**Opção A — Talking Head:**
Apenas você contando a história. Funciona bem.

**Opção B — Screenshots:**
Mostrar antes/depois do site (se tiver permissão)

**Opção C — Métricas:**
Gráfico simples mostrando 12 → 40+ demos

**Opção D — Split Screen:**
Antes (site genérico) / Depois (site estratégico)

| Agência EUA | 3x preço cobrado | - |
| E-commerce UK | 1.2% → 4.8% conversão | - |

## Caption Sugerida (Instagram)

```
12 demos a month.

That's what this SaaS founder was getting before we rebuilt his digital presence.

60 days later? Over 40.

Same product. Same market. Same ad spend.

The only thing that changed was the system.

---

Here's what was broken:

His dashboard was functional. Product was solid.

But the website?
→ Looked like a template
→ Generic messaging ("We help businesses grow")
→ Nothing that made buyers think "this is for ME"

The site was technically fine.
Strategically? Invisible.

---

What we did:

1. Defined his exact ideal client (not "businesses" — specific founders with specific problems)

2. Rewrote every word of copy to speak directly to that person

3. Restructured page flow so every section answered an objection at the right moment

4. Added automation so leads got nurtured automatically

---

The result?

✓ Demos tripled in 60 days
✓ Same ad budget
✓ Sales team said leads were MORE qualified
✓ People showed up already understanding the value

That's strategic positioning.

Your product probably isn't the problem.
Your system might be.
