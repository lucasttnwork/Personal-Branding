# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 2

## Theme: "Why Your Site Talks to Everyone and Sells to No One"
## Duration: 60 seconds

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "Your site says 'We help businesses grow.' So does everyone else's."

- "Generic messaging = generic results (aka zero)"

- "This is why your site gets traffic but no leads"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "Your site says 'We help businesses grow.' So does every other site in your industry. And that's exactly why no one is clicking your CTA."

- "Here's a question: If I asked you who your site is for, would you say 'business owners' or 'entrepreneurs'? If so, that's exactly why it's not converting."

- "Your competitor's site looks almost identical to yours. Same messaging. Same stock photos. Same generic promises. And you're both wondering why leads aren't coming in."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: 4-5 competitor websites all showing nearly identical generic headlines ("We help businesses succeed", "Your trusted partner", "Solutions for growth")

- Screenshot of a generic site homepage with the headline circled: "We serve businesses of all sizes" — crossed out

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, coffee in hand, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Why your site talks to everyone and sells to no one"

**Narration:**

*Your site says "We help businesses grow." So does every other site in your industry. And that's exactly why no one is clicking your CTA.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing Miro board being opened. You create a section titled "ICP Definition."

**Narration:**

*Day 2 of rebuilding my own client acquisition system. And before I touch a single pixel of design, I'm doing something most business owners never do: getting ruthlessly specific about who this is actually for. Because here's what I've learned building systems for premium businesses...*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:35]

Screen recording: You add specific details to the ICP board, but the focus is on the INSIGHT, not the process.

Categories briefly visible:
- "Not 'business owners'" → "Founders, 38-55, running $500k+ businesses"
- "Not 'anyone who needs a website'" → "B2B SaaS or premium local businesses"
- "Not '$500 budget'" → "$5k-$10k ready to invest"

**Narration:**

*When your site speaks to "businesses" or "entrepreneurs," it actually speaks to no one. Here's why: Your ideal client — let's call him James — is a 45-year-old founder running a SaaS doing six figures. He has a premium offer. He has the budget to invest in positioning. But when he lands on your generic site, his brain instantly categorizes you as "just another option." Because nothing on your site tells him: "This was built for someone exactly like me."*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:35 - 00:50]

Screen recording: You add a final post-it: "Every design decision answers: Would James trust this?"

**Narration:**

*Meanwhile, your competitor who DID this work? Their site feels like it's reading James's mind. It names his exact problem. It speaks his language. It makes him feel understood. So when James is ready to buy, who does he call? Not the generic site. The one that felt like it was built for him.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:50 - 01:00]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 3: The objections you're not addressing"

**Narration:**

*This is what we do for clients on Day 1. Before colors. Before fonts. Before code. We figure out exactly who we're building for — so every word, every image, every button speaks directly to them. Tomorrow: the hidden objections killing your conversions before visitors even scroll. Link in bio if you want this done for your business.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick test: pull up your website and read your headline out loud. Would it work for literally any business in your industry? If yes, you're invisible to your ideal client.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*This is Day 2 of 14. By the end, you'll see exactly what separates a generic site from a client acquisition system. Follow to watch — or link in bio if you want one built for you.*

**Option 3 (Direct):**

*Generic sites attract generic leads — or no leads at all. We build systems that speak directly to your highest-value prospects. Link in bio.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** The hook immediately names James's problem (generic messaging) rather than announcing "today we'll define the ICP."

2. **No Tutorial Language:** Avoid phrases like "here's how to define your ICP" or "let me show you my process." Instead: "here's what most business owners never realize."

3. **James as Character:** James is introduced as a relatable person, not as a framework component. He's someone the viewer might know — or might be.

4. **Consequence Focus:** The "competitor who did this work" angle creates urgency without being pushy.

5. **Service CTA:** Every CTA hints at the service ("link in bio if you want this done for your business") rather than teaching them to replicate.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "ICP definition process," "Miro board," "post-its," "let me show you how"
   - USE: "ideal client," "highest-value prospects," "speaks directly to," "built for someone exactly like you"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
