# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 3

## Theme: "The Hidden Objections Killing Your Conversions"
## Duration: 65 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "In the first 10 seconds, your visitor thinks 'Can I trust this?'"

- "Your visitors have objections. You're not answering them."

- "They left your site. Here's what they were thinking."

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "In the first 10 seconds on your site, your visitor thinks 'Can I trust this?' Do you answer that question? Or do they just... bounce?"

- "Your visitors don't leave because your site is ugly. They leave because you didn't answer the question they had at the exact moment they had it."

- "There's a conversation happening in your visitor's head every second they're on your site. Objections, fears, questions. If you're not addressing them in real-time, you're losing them."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Animation: thought bubbles appearing above a person scrolling a website — "Is this legit?" "Have they worked with someone like me?" "Can I afford this?"

- Screen recording of a website with annotations showing what the visitor is thinking at each scroll point

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera with slight intensity.

**Text on Screen:** "The objections killing your conversions"

**Narration:**

*In the first 10 seconds on your site, your visitor is already asking: "Can I trust this?" Do you answer that question? Or do they just... bounce?*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing Miro board. You're mapping out visitor psychology at different stages.

**Narration:**

*Day 3 of building my own acquisition system. Today I'm mapping something most businesses never think about: what is your visitor feeling at every single second they're on your site? Because here's what I've learned...*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:40]

Screen recording showing the journey map with emotional annotations, but framed as INSIGHT for James, not tutorial.

Visible elements:
- "Second 3: 'Is this for me or everyone?'"
- "Second 10: 'Can I trust them?'"
- "Second 30: 'Have they solved this before?'"
- "Second 60: 'Is this worth the investment?'"

**Narration:**

*At 3 seconds, your visitor asks: "Is this for me or just generic?" That's why yesterday's work on specificity matters. At 10 seconds: "Can I trust this person?" If there's no credibility signal — logos, results, recognition — they're mentally checking out. At 30 seconds: "Have they actually solved this problem before?" Without proof, you're just making promises. At 60 seconds: "Is this worth what they're probably charging?" Every moment has an objection. And if you're not answering it AT that moment, you're losing them.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:40 - 00:52]

Screen recording: You draw arrows connecting objections to where they need to be addressed on the site.

**Narration:**

*This is why most sites feel "off" even when they look good. The visitor has a question. The answer exists somewhere on the page — maybe. But it's in the wrong place. It comes too late. By the time they scroll to it, they've already decided you're not for them. Timing isn't just important. It's everything.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:52 - 01:05]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 4: Where your testimonials actually belong"

**Narration:**

*This is why we map the entire visitor journey before designing a single thing. Every section, every element is positioned to answer the right objection at the right moment. Tomorrow: you probably have testimonials on your site. But they're probably in the wrong place. Link in bio if you want us to audit yours.*

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Here's a test: scroll through your site slowly. At each section, ask "what objection does this answer?" If you can't name it, that section might be decoration.*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*This is how we design sites that convert — by engineering answers to questions your visitors haven't even asked yet. Link in bio to see how we do it for businesses like yours.*

**Option 3 (Engagement):**

*What's the #1 objection YOUR ideal client has before buying? Drop it in the comments — I'll tell you where it should appear on your site.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** The hook puts James in his visitor's shoes — forcing him to think about what HIS visitors are experiencing.

2. **Psychology Frame:** This is framed as "visitor psychology" not "customer journey mapping." James cares about his visitors' experience, not methodology names.

3. **Time-Based Structure:** Using specific timestamps (3 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.) makes this concrete and memorable.

4. **Consequence Focus:** "By the time they scroll to it, they've already decided" creates urgency.

5. **Service CTA:** "Link in bio if you want us to audit yours" offers a service, not a DIY template.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Customer journey mapping," "5-stage funnel," "touchpoints," "let me show you the process"
   - USE: "Visitor psychology," "objections," "questions they're asking," "answering at the right moment"

- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
