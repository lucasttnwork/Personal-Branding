# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 14

## Theme: "This Is What Working While You Sleep Actually Looks Like"
## Duration: 75 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "I woke up to 3 qualified leads in my CRM. Here's how."

- "What 'working while you sleep' actually looks like"

- "This is the difference between a site and a SYSTEM"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "I woke up to 3 qualified leads in my CRM. No cold outreach. No manual work. Here's what a real client acquisition system does while you sleep."

- "Every business owner wants a system that generates leads on autopilot. Most have no idea what that actually means. Let me show you."

- "You've seen the site. It's beautiful. It's fast. It's strategic. But THIS is what makes it a machine, not a brochure."

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Dashboard showing leads coming in, emails sending, calls being booked — all automated

- Phone notification: "New Lead: John from TechCorp" — happening without any action

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "This is what 'works while you sleep' actually looks like"

**Narration:**

*I woke up to 3 qualified leads in my CRM. No cold outreach. No manual work. Here's what a real client acquisition system does while you sleep.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing automation dashboard with workflows visible.

**Narration:**

*Day 14. The finale. Everything we've built over 13 days — strategy, design, code — is live. But here's the layer that turns all of it into a machine: automation. This is where a website becomes a system.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:40]

Screen recording: You show the automation workflow — but focus on WHAT happens for James's leads, not HOW to build it.

Flow shown:
1. Visitor fills out form
2. Instantly added to CRM + tagged
3. Welcome email sends (within seconds)
4. Nurture sequence begins
5. If they engage → fast-tracked
6. Calendar booking available
7. Reminders send automatically

**Narration:**

*Here's what happens now. Someone lands on the site — we've engineered every step to guide them to the form. They fill it out. Instantly — not when I check my inbox — instantly they're added to my CRM. Tagged. Scored. A welcome email fires immediately. They feel seen, not ignored. Then the nurture sequence begins. Day 2: a case study lands in their inbox. Day 4: valuable content that builds trust. Day 7: an invitation to book a call. If they click, calendar opens, they pick a slot that works. Confirmation. Reminders. All automatic. All happening while I'm with other clients. Or sleeping.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:40 - 00:55]

Screen recording: Dashboard showing leads in pipeline, emails sent, calls booked.

**Narration:**

*This is what separates a website from a client acquisition system. Most businesses have a beautiful site that waits for someone to take action — and then hopes the business owner responds fast enough. This system captures, nurtures, and books automatically. The site does its job. The automation does the rest. No leads fall through the cracks. No prospects get ghosted. No opportunities missed because you were busy.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:55 - 01:15]

Full-circle moment: Day 1 empty Miro board → Day 14 complete system. You look at camera.

**Narration:**

*Fourteen days. From empty strategic board to a complete client acquisition machine. Every element engineered. Every piece working together. This is what we build for premium businesses. Not a website. Not a brochure. A system that generates qualified leads while you focus on what you do best. That's the series. That's what's possible. Link in bio if you want one built for your business.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** "I woke up to 3 qualified leads" — shows the RESULT James wants, not the process.

2. **System Walkthrough:** The automation flow is explained as what happens TO LEADS, not how to build automations. James wants results, not tutorials.

3. **"While You Sleep" Repeated:** This phrase is James's dream. Repeat it throughout.

4. **Full Circle:** The Day 1 → Day 14 visual closes the narrative loop and demonstrates the complete transformation.

5. **Service CTA:** Every CTA points to hiring, not learning. "Built for your business" — not "learn how to build."

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "Zapier," "Make," "automation workflow," "trigger conditions," "CRM integration setup"
   - USE: "Automatically," "instantly," "while you sleep," "no leads fall through," "system"

## Series Conclusion Notes

This episode serves as both:
1. **Finale** — completing the 14-day narrative arc
2. **Sales tool** — making it crystal clear what James should do next

The entire series has been reframed from "teaching designers how to work" to "showing James what he's missing and why he should hire this service."

---

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate

## Full Series Transformation Summary

### What We Changed:

| Original Approach | New Approach |
|-------------------|--------------|
| "Here's how to define your ICP" | "Here's why your site speaks to no one" |
| "Let me show you customer journey mapping" | "The objections you're not answering" |
| "Watch me build a wireframe" | "Why your 'pretty' site doesn't convert" |
| "My design process" | "Colors are psychology, not decoration" |
| "Technical handoff documentation" | "Why your site came back different" |
| "Here's my automation setup" | "What working while you sleep looks like" |

### Who This Now Attracts:

- James/Sarah: Established business owner with budget
- Someone who WANTS TO HIRE, not learn
- Premium B2B and B2C businesses
- Decision-makers who value their time

### Who This No Longer Attracts:

- Web designers wanting to learn methodology
- DIY entrepreneurs who will do it themselves
- Agencies looking for processes to copy
- Low-budget "can you just make it look nice" clients
