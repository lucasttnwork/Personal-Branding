# Roteiro: Building in Public - Day 7

## Theme: "Your Headline Is About You. That's Why It Doesn't Work."
## Duration: 65 seconds

---

## Hook Options (Focused on James's Pain)

**1. Text on Screen:**

- "'We are a leading provider of solutions.' That's your headline?"

- "Your headline talks about YOU. Your visitor doesn't care."

- "Why visitors leave in 3 seconds (it's your first line)"

**2. Direct Narration Hook:**

- "'We are a leading provider of solutions.' That's your headline? That's why visitors leave in 3 seconds."

- "Read your homepage headline. Does it talk about YOU or about your CLIENT'S problem? If it's about you, you've already lost them."

- "Your headline has one job: make someone think 'this is exactly what I need.' Does yours do that? Or does it sound like every other company in your industry?"

**3. Visual Hook:**

- Split screen: generic headline ("We provide premium services") vs. pain-focused headline ("Stop losing clients to competitors with better positioning")

- Montage of 5 competitor headlines that all sound identical

## Video Script

### Scene 1 - PAIN [00:00 - 00:05]

You at the setup, looking directly at camera.

**Text on Screen:** "Your headline is about YOU. That's the problem."

**Narration:**

*"We are a leading provider of solutions." That's your headline? That's why visitors leave in 3 seconds.*

---

### Scene 2 - PROOF [00:05 - 00:15]

Quick cut to screen recording showing a document with headline drafts being written.

**Narration:**

*Day 7 of building my acquisition system. Today: the words that fill the structure. And here's where most businesses completely miss the mark. They write about themselves. "We help." "We provide." "We deliver." No one cares. Your visitor cares about ONE thing: their problem.*

---

### Scene 3 - PATH [00:15 - 00:38]

Screen recording: You show three headline versions being tested.

- Version 1: "We Build Premium Websites" — crossed out, note: "About me, not them"
- Version 2: "Your Site Should Be Your Best Salesperson" — note: "Better, still vague"
- Version 3: "Stop Losing High-Value Clients to Competitors With Better Positioning" — highlighted

**Narration:**

*Watch this. Version 1: "We build premium websites." It's about me. Deleted. Version 2: "Your site should be your best salesperson." Better — it's about outcome. But still generic. Version 3: "Stop losing high-value clients to competitors with better positioning." Now we're naming the pain. The fear. The thing keeping my ideal client up at night. That's the headline that stops the scroll.*

---

### Scene 4 - COST [00:38 - 00:52]

Screen recording: You add supporting copy below the headline.

**Narration:**

*Here's what most businesses don't realize: your visitor decides in 3 seconds whether to stay or leave. Three seconds. If your headline sounds like everyone else's, their brain categorizes you as "just another option" and they're gone. The words you choose aren't creative expression. They're your first — and maybe only — chance to be heard.*

---

### Scene 5 - CTA [00:52 - 01:05]

You look at camera. Text appears: "Day 8: Design psychology (not just pretty colors)"

**Narration:**

*Every word on this site is engineered to speak directly to my ideal client's fears and desires. Not clever. Not cute. Effective. Tomorrow: colors aren't decoration — they're psychology. Link in bio if you want copy that actually converts, not just sounds nice.*

---

## Call to Action Options

**Option 1 (Self-Diagnosis):**

*Quick exercise: pull up your site. Read your headline out loud. Does it name your visitor's specific pain? Or does it talk about you?*

**Option 2 (Service-Oriented):**

*We write headlines that make your ideal client think "this is exactly what I need." That's the first step to a conversion. Link in bio.*

**Option 3 (Contrast):**

*Generic copy attracts no one. Specific copy attracts your perfect client. That's the difference between traffic and leads. Follow for more.*

## Production Notes

1. **Pain-First Opening:** Directly quotes a bad headline and names the consequence — 3-second bounce.

2. **Iteration Process:** Showing three versions demonstrates thinking without being a tutorial. James sees the quality of decision-making, not a DIY framework.

3. **Time Pressure:** "3 seconds" creates urgency and makes the stakes clear.

4. **Anti-Clever:** "Not clever. Not cute. Effective." — positions this as business results, not creative writing.

5. **Service CTA:** "Copy that actually converts" — positions this as something you buy.

6. **Vocabulary Check:**
   - AVOID: "PAS framework," "AIDA model," "copywriting methodology," "headline formulas"
   - USE: "Words that work," "naming the pain," "speaking to fears and desires," "stops the scroll"

## Alignment Checklist

- [x] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology
- [x] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process
- [x] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"
- [x] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"
- [x] Complexity shown is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate
