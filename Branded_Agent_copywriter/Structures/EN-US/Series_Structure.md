| 0:00-0:05 | **Context** | "Part X of Y" + 1-sentence recap |
| 0:06-0:12 | **Episode Hook** | What this episode will solve |
| 0:13-0:40 | **Content** | The complete insight |
| 0:41-0:50 | **Takeaway** | What to take from this episode |
| 0:51-0:60 | **Cliffhanger** | Question only the next episode answers |

```

### Episode 2: The Framework

Content: Overview of the method/framework
Cliffhanger: "The first step is..." → Ep. 3
```

### Episode 3: Step 1
```
Hook: First step of the framework
Content: How to execute + example
Cliffhanger: "Once that's done, here's where it gets tricky..." → Ep. 4
```

### Episode 4: Steps 2-3
```

Cliffhanger: "And now, the part nobody talks about..." → Ep. 5
```
