## Full Script

**[0:00-0:05 | VPB1]**
🎦 *You're seated, slightly lower lighting, confessional tone. Holding an old project folder.*
🟨 TEXT: "The project that changed everything"
🗣 "Alright, let me tell you about the project that almost made me quit."

**[0:06-0:20 | Story Setup]**
🎦 *You open the folder, show old printed screenshots (blurred)*
🗣 "2019. Consulting firm client. Strong revenue, solid team. They asked for a website. I delivered a website. Beautiful, modern, responsive. Everything they asked for."

**[0:21-0:35 | The Conflict]**
🎦 *You close the folder, frustrated expression*
🟨 TEXT: "3 months later: zero leads"
🗣 "Three months later, I get a call. 'Lucas, the site looks great. But we haven't gotten a single lead. Not one.' And the truth? I knew it was coming. I just didn't know why."

**[0:36-0:52 | VPB2 - The Revelation]**
🎦 *You stand up, walk to whiteboard. Draw three disconnected circles: "Design" / "Strategy" / "Technology"*
🗣 "That's when it clicked: I had delivered the right pieces... but not the system. The design was premium, but the messaging was generic. The tech worked, but there was no funnel. It was an **orchestra without a conductor**."

**[0:53-1:08 | The Turn - Methodology]**
🎦 *You connect the three circles with arrows, write "F.O.C.O." in the center*
🟨 TEXT: "Foundation. Orchestration. Construction. Operation."
🗣 "That's where what I now call the F.O.C.O. Method was born. Foundation: understand the business before creating anything. Orchestration: design the journey. Construction: only then comes the site. Operation: automation that qualifies. One system, not a Frankenstein."

**[1:09-1:20 | VPB3 - Result]**
🎦 *You show a thank-you message screenshot (blurred)*
🗣 "I went back to that same client a year later. Rebuilt it with the method. In 60 days, they tripled their booked demos. Not because of the design. Because now everything worked together."

**[1:21-1:30 | VPB4 + CTA]**
🎦 *Sticky note on lens: "SYSTEM"*
🗣 "If you've ever felt like vendors delivered the pieces but not the result... comment **SYSTEM**. I'll tell you how to avoid the same mistake."
✂️ *Fade out or cut to beginning.*
