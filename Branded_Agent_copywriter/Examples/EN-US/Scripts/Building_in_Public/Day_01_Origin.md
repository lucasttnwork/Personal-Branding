## Full Script

**[0:00-0:05 | VPB1]**
🎦 *You in front of a blank screen (Figma, Notion, or empty IDE)*
🟨 TEXT: "Day 1 of 30"
🗣 "Alright, here we go. Day 1. Blank screen. And a decision that, I'll admit, makes me a bit uncomfortable."

**[0:06-0:18 | The Decision]**
🎦 *You step back from the screen, look at camera*
🗣 "I help companies build client acquisition systems. But today I'm doing something different: I'm building my own system—from zero—and documenting every step. Publicly."

**[0:19-0:30 | The Why]**
🎦 *Cut to you walking, more casual tone*
🟨 TEXT: "Showing the process, not just the result"
🗣 "Why? Because portfolios show the final result. But nobody shows the tough decisions, the mistakes, the doubts in the middle. And that's where the real learning is."

**[0:31-0:42 | VPB2 - The Method]**
🎦 *You show a sticky note with "F.O.C.O." written on it*
🗣 "Over the next 30 days, I'll apply the same F.O.C.O. Method I use with clients: Foundation, Orchestration, Construction, Operation. One stage per week. You'll see everything."

**[0:43-0:52 | The Promise]**
🎦 *You look directly at camera, more serious tone*
🟨 TEXT: "Total transparency"
🗣 "I'll show what works. And especially what doesn't. Because if I can't do this for my own business, why would you trust me to do it for yours?"

**[0:53-0:60 | VPB3 + CTA]**
🎦 *You place a sticky note on the camera lens: "DAY 1"*
🗣 "If you want to follow this journey—and maybe learn something along the way—save this video. Tomorrow: defining the ideal client. See you there."
✂️ *Cut to beginning or fade out.*

## Why This Works (US Market)

- **Strategic Vulnerability:** "Makes me uncomfortable" creates authenticity
- **Serialized Curiosity:** "30 days" creates anticipation to follow along
- **Skin in the Game:** Applying to own business = proof of confidence
- **Powerful Question:** The rhetorical question about trust is impactful
- **Cliffhanger:** "Tomorrow: defining the ideal client" creates anticipation
- **Soft CTA:** "Save" is less committal than "comment"
- **Building in Public Trend:** Very resonant with US startup/founder culture
- **Accountability:** American audience values public accountability and transparency
