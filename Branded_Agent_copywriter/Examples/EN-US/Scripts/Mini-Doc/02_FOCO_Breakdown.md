## Full Script

**[0:00-0:05 | VPB1]**
🎦 *Clean whiteboard. You write "F.O.C.O." in large letters*
🟨 TEXT: "The method that changes everything"
🗣 "Alright, let's dive in. F.O.C.O. Four stages. A sequence that, if you skip one, the results won't come."

**[0:06-0:22 | F - Foundation]**
🎦 *You draw a building and point to the base*
🟨 TEXT: "F = Foundation"
🗣 "First: **Foundation**. Before touching design or code, we stop. Who is your ideal client? What problem do you really solve? How do you position differently from competitors? (Sounds basic, but 80% of companies can't answer this clearly.)"

**[0:23-0:38 | O - Orchestration]**
🎦 *You draw a line with dots: visitor → lead → call*
🟨 TEXT: "O = Orchestration"
🗣 "Second: **Orchestration**. This is where we design the journey. Where does the visitor enter? What information do they need to see first? What's the one action we want them to take? In other words: we turn your site into a GPS that guides them to conversion."

**[0:39-0:54 | C - Construction]**
🎦 *You show a screen with code/design side by side*
🟨 TEXT: "C = Construction"
🗣 "Third: **Construction**. Only now comes the website, the landing page, the frontend. But with a difference: every pixel, every word, every button already has a defined purpose from the previous stages. It's not 'making it pretty.' It's building a machine."

**[0:55-1:10 | O - Operation]**
🎦 *You show an automation flowchart: form → email → qualification → booking*
🟨 TEXT: "O = Operation"
🗣 "Fourth: **Operation**. The living system. Automations that capture, nurture, and qualify leads while you sleep. Someone fills out your form at 3 AM? By 8 AM they've received an email sequence and there's a meeting booked on your calendar."

**[1:11-1:20 | VPB2 - Synthesis]**
🎦 *You circle all four letters on the board*
🗣 "Foundation. Orchestration. Construction. Operation. In that order. Skip one? The system breaks."

**[1:21-1:30 | VPB3 + CTA]**
🎦 *Sticky note on lens: "FOCO"*
🗣 "If you want to see how this would work for your business... comment **FOCO**. I'll send you a quick diagnostic of which stage you're missing."
✂️ *Cut to beginning or fade out.*

## CTA

- **Pre-CTA**: "If you want to see how this would work for your business..."
