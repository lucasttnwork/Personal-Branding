2. "Your conversion rate doesn't need motivation. It needs architecture."
3. "The fastest way to stop competing on price? Fix what your website communicates."

## Full Script

**[0:00-0:04 | VPB1]**
🎦 *You slam a folder on desk labeled "LEADS" — empty.*
🟨 TEXT: "$ spent. 0 confidence."
🗣 "This was a real business problem: strong offer, weak digital perception."

**[0:05-0:18]**
🎦 *On-screen numbers pop as you speak*
🟨 TEXT: "Before: 1.2% CVR" → "After: 4.8% CVR"
🗣 "In one case, the landing page was converting at 1.2%. After rebuilding it as a system—message, UX, performance—it jumped to 4.8%."

**[0:19-0:35 | VPB2]**
🎦 *Split screen "BEFORE / AFTER" with printed screenshots. Use a red marker circling issues.*
🗣 "What changed wasn't 'more fancy UI'. It was removing **strategic digital dissonance**: the page finally matched the reality of the business."

**[0:36-0:58 | The 4 Moves]**
🎦 *Whiteboard list appears; each item gets checked*
🟨 TEXT: "FOCO"
🗣 "We follow a simple sequence:
(1) Foundation: positioning + ICP clarity.
(2) Orchestration: the journey + one next step.
(3) Build: speed, frontend, trust cues.
(4) Operate: automation to qualify and schedule."

**[0:59-1:12 | VPB3]**
🎦 *You set a calendar invite on screen: "Demo booked". Ding sound.*
🔊 SFX: *calendar "ding"*
🗣 "That's how you stop relying on referrals. Your site becomes a sales rep that works 24/7."

**[1:13-1:25 | VPB4 + CTA + Scarcity]**
🎦 *You hold up two fingers: "2 slots"*
🟨 TEXT: "2 projects/month"
🗣 "If you're an established business doing real revenue and your site doesn't reflect it—comment **ASSET**. I take two projects a month."

## Structure Applied

```
HOOK (numerical result)
    ↓
PROOF (before/after with data)
    ↓
DIAGNOSIS (what was wrong)
    ↓
MECHANISM (FOCO methodology)
    ↓
RESULT + SCARCITY + CTA
```

---

## Why This Works

- **Specific numbers:** 1.2% → 4.8% = immediate credibility
- **Visual contrast:** Before/after with markings = tangible proof
- **Named mechanism:** FOCO = methodological authority
- **Real scarcity:** "2 projects a month" = qualifying urgency
