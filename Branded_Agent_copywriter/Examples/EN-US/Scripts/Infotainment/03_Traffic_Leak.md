## Full Script

**[0:00-0:04 | VPB1]**
🎦 *You pour water into a fancy cup that has a hole at the bottom—water leaks out*
🟨 TEXT: "This is how your paid traffic works"
🔊 SFX: *water dripping/leaking sound*
🗣 "Alright, here's the uncomfortable truth. If your paid traffic isn't converting, the problem probably isn't the traffic."

**[0:05-0:15]**
🎦 *You point to the leaking cup*
🗣 "Generally speaking, the scenario looks like this: ads running, clicks coming in, budget burning... and qualified leads? Almost none. So the reflex is 'let me increase the budget.' But here's the thing..."

**[0:16-0:28 | VPB2]**
🎦 *You show two cups: one with a hole, one intact. Pour water into both.*
🟨 TEXT: "More water ≠ More results"
🗣 "Pouring more water into a cup with a hole doesn't fill it up. Your traffic is leaking because your landing page doesn't have **conversion architecture**."

**[0:29-0:42]**
🎦 *Computer screen showing metrics: "Bounce Rate 78%" - "Conversion 1.2%"*
🗣 "Look at this: 78% bounce rate. In other words, out of every 100 people you're paying to land on your page, 78 leave without clicking anything. In practice, that means your ad spend is literally going down the drain."

**[0:43-0:52 | VPB3]**
🎦 *You plug the hole in the cup, pour water—it stays full*
🟨 TEXT: "Fix the leak first"
🗣 "The move isn't more traffic. It's fixing the leak. Aligning message, experience, and funnel so every visit has a real shot at becoming a lead."

**[0:53-0:60 | VPB4 + CTA + Loop]**
🎦 *Sticky note on lens: "LEAK"*
🗣 "If you're investing in traffic and not seeing returns... comment **LEAK** and I'll send you the checklist to identify where it's draining."
✂️ *Hard cut back to first frame (loop).*
