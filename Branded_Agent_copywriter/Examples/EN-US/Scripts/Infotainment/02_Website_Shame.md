## Full Script

**[0:00-0:04 | VPB1]**
🎦 *Close on phone, thumb hovering over "Send" button on a text message*
🟨 TEXT: "Have you frozen here?"
🔊 SFX: *message typing sound stops*
🗣 "Alright, let's talk about something nobody admits. This moment right here? It's way more common than you'd think."

**[0:05-0:15]**
🎦 *You pull the phone away, look at camera with knowing expression*
🗣 "Successful founder. Business running. Clients satisfied. But when it's time to text your website link to that high-value prospect? Pause. Hesitation. That thought: 'Will they think we're small-time?'"

**[0:16-0:26 | VPB2]**
🎦 *Split screen: left side "BUSINESS" (premium icon), right side "WEBSITE" (generic template icon)*
🟨 TEXT: "The Dissonance"
🗣 "This has a name: **Strategic Digital Dissonance**. Your business is premium, but your digital presence tells a different story."

**[0:27-0:40]**
🎦 *You draw on whiteboard: "VALUE" and "PERCEPTION" with broken arrow between them*
🗣 "Generally speaking, the problem isn't lack of pretty design. It's lack of alignment. Strategy says one thing, visuals say another, and the funnel? Doesn't exist."

**[0:41-0:50 | VPB3]**
🎦 *You hold up a sticky note: "Website = Proof of Competence"*
🟨 TEXT: "Your site is proof, not a brochure"
🗣 "Your website isn't a business card. It's **material proof of your competence**. If it doesn't impress, the client doubts you before they ever see your work."

**[0:51-0:60 | VPB4 + CTA + Loop]**
🎦 *You place sticky note on camera lens: "SYNC"*
🗣 "If you also hesitate before sending your link... comment **SYNC**. I'll send you the checklist I use to fix this."
✂️ *Hard cut back to first frame (loop).*
