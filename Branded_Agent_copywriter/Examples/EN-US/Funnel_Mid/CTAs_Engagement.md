# Engagement CTAs - Middle of Funnel (EN-US)

## Overview

Medium-friction CTAs for the consideration phase. The goal is to deepen the relationship, collect audience information, and create initial direct touchpoints (DMs, qualified comments, downloads). These CTAs ask for more commitment than top-of-funnel but are not direct sales asks.

**Tone:** Generous, collaborative, expert-to-expert
**Objective:** Qualify leads, collect data, start conversations
**Funnel stage:** Consideration (30%)

## Usage Rules

1. **Resource CTAs** require delivery - have the resource ready before posting
2. **Analysis CTAs** take time - limit quantity (e.g., "I'll pick 3")
3. **DM CTAs** are highest quality - ideal for identifying real prospects
4. **Series CTAs** create commitment - only use if you'll actually post the follow-up
5. **Vary between categories** so you don't seem like you're just selling
6. **Always deliver value first** - the CTA comes after educational content
7. **Personalization CTAs** generate valuable data about audience composition
8. American audiences appreciate efficiency - keep resource delivery fast (within 24h)
9. Be specific about what you're offering - vague CTAs get ignored
