## Application Notes

1. **Conversion hooks should be used sparingly** - 20% of content max
2. **Always have proof** before using social proof hooks (screenshots, testimonials, metrics)
3. **Scarcity must be real** - don't invent limitations that don't exist
4. **Use after warming the audience** - don't sell to new arrivals
5. **Include guarantee** when possible - reduces resistance
6. **Direct tone, not aggressive** - justify value, don't pressure
7. **Connect to the pain** established in top-of-funnel content
8. **Reinforce brand terminology**: Premium Acquisition System, Synchronous Conversion Architecture
9. American audiences respond well to specific numbers and dollar amounts
10. Confidence is expected - hedging language undermines the offer
