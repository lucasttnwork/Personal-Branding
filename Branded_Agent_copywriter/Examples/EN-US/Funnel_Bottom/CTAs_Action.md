## Usage Rules

1. **Action CTAs only work with warmed audiences** - don't use on first contact
2. **Scarcity MUST be real** - lying destroys trust and reputation
3. **Guarantee reduces friction** - include whenever possible
4. **One CTA per content** - multiple CTAs confuse and reduce conversion
5. **Clear next step** - people need to know exactly what to do
6. **Combine triggers** - Scarcity + Guarantee is a powerful combination
7. **Respond fast** - if you asked for DM/comment, respond within 24 hours
8. **Qualify before selling** - not everyone interested is a fit
9. **Confident tone, not desperate** - you're offering something valuable, not begging
10. American audiences expect directness - don't over-apologize or hedge
11. Use dollar amounts when discussing value and results (more concrete)
