## How to Use in Scripts

### Ideal Positioning
- **Turning point** → After revealing the problem
- **Takeaway** → As conclusion before CTA
- **On-screen text** → Visual highlight with zoom

### Formatting
```
🎦 Aggressive zoom-in on face
🟨 "Perfectionism is procrastination wearing cologne."
🔊 SFX: *clack* (sharp beat)
🗣 [1 second pause before continuing]
```

### Tips
- Use at most 1-2 punchlines per video
- The phrase needs to be **self-sufficient** (make sense in isolation)
- Combine with impact VPB (zoom, hard cut, lighting change)
