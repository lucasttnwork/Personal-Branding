## How to Use in Scripts

### Strategic Insertion
```
[Main content]
    ↓
🗣 "And before you say: 'but I don't have time'..."
🎦 [Pause + direct eye contact]
🗣 "Perfect. Then you need a ready-made script, not inspiration."
    ↓
[Continue content]
```

### Ideal Moment
- **After presenting the solution** — preempts resistance
- **Before CTA** — removes barrier to action

### Tips
- Use at most 1-2 objections per video
- Choose objections you know your audience has
- The response should be short and definitive—no long explanation
