# Hooks — Storytelling

> **How to use:** Storytelling hooks open with vulnerability or a specific scene.
> They require a short backstory and a "breaking point" as a zoom-in moment.

## Usage Notes

- **Ideal duration:** 60-90 seconds (storytelling needs time)
- **Tone:** Intimate, reflective, honest
- **Goal:** Emotional connection + identification + authority through experience
- **Caution:** Don't over-romanticize—be specific, not generic
- **Tip:** Use sensory details (place, time, exact phrase) to create immersion
