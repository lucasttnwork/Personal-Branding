# VPBs — Visual Pattern Breaks

> **How to use:** VPBs are visual changes that break monotony and hold attention.
> Every script should have 3-5 VPBs, with VPB1 in the hook being the most impactful.
> Use real objects, angle changes, and practical elements.

## Usage Rules

### Distribution in Script
```
VPB1 [0:00-0:03]  → Hook (most impactful)
VPB2 [0:12-0:15]  → Development
VPB3 [0:25-0:30]  → Breaking point
VPB4 [0:40-0:45]  → Turning point/Solution
VPB5 [0:55-1:00]  → CTA/Loop
```

### Principles
- **Hook VPB is critical** — decides if the viewer stays
- **VPB must have purpose** — not decoration, it's message reinforcement
- **Real objects > digital effects** — more authentic, less "produced"
- **Speech ↔ image integration** — visual should complement, not compete

### Notation Symbols
- 🎦 = Camera/scene direction
- 🗣 = Speaker's line
- 🟨 = On-screen text
- 🔊 = Sound effect
- ✂️ = Cut/transition
