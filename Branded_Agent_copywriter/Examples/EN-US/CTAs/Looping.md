# CTAs — Looping

> **How to use:** Looping CTAs close the video by connecting to the initial hook.
> They create a "restart" feeling that encourages automatic rewatch.

## How the Loop Works

### Visual Structure
```
HOOK: "You're doing X the expensive way..."
  ↓
CONTENT
  ↓
LOOP CTA: "And that's why I started by saying: you're doing X the expensive way..."
  ↓
[HARD CUT to the beginning]
```

### Psychological Effect
- The viewer "falls" into the beginning without realizing
- Increases watch time
- Algorithm interprets as high-retention content

## Types of Loops

### Literal Loop
Repeats the exact hook phrase:
- "And that's why I started by saying: [HOOK]…"

### Conceptual Loop
Connects the conclusion to the initial theme:
- "And that's when I realized: [HOOK]…"

### Question Loop
Leaves a question that refers to the beginning:
- "And the question I leave you with is: [HOOK]?"

### Challenge Loop
Provokes the viewer to revisit:
- "Now go back to the beginning and watch it with this lens."

## Technical Execution

1. **Record the ending looking at camera** (like in the hook)
2. **Use the same tone of voice as the beginning**
3. **Hard cut, no fade**—directly to the first frame
4. **Sync the rhythm**—the last syllable should "blend" into the first

## Usage Tips

- Loops work best in short videos (30-60s)
- The hook needs to be strong enough to support repetition
- Don't use loops if the content doesn't naturally close the cycle
- Combine with mid-video Pre-CTA for double engagement
