## 10. Examples of Well-Adapted Copy

### Example 1: Hero Section Headline

**Original (PT-BR concept):**
> "Seu site bonito nao vende porque parece uma Ferrari com motor de Fusca"

**US Adaptation:**
> "Your Beautiful Website Isn't Selling Because It's a Ferrari Body on a Golf Cart Chassis"
>
> Stunning design means nothing without conversion engineering. We build digital assets that look the part AND close deals.

**UK Adaptation:**
> "A Stunning Website That Doesn't Convert Is Rather Like an Aston Martin With a Fiat Engine"
>
> Beautiful, yes. Functional? Not quite. We engineer digital assets that match form with performance.

---

### Example 2: Problem Agitation

**Original (PT-BR concept):**
> "Voce nao precisa de mais um site bonito. Voce precisa de um sistema."

**US Adaptation:**
> "You don't need another pretty website. You need a client acquisition machine.
>
> Your competitors aren't winning because they have better services — they're winning because their digital presence is doing the heavy lifting. While you're manually chasing leads, they've got a system working 24/7.
>
> Here's the uncomfortable truth: that $15,000 website you're proud of? It's probably costing you $60,000+ per year in lost deals."

**UK Adaptation:**
> "Another attractive website won't solve your problem. A proven client acquisition system will.
>
> Your competitors aren't necessarily better at what they do — they've simply invested in digital infrastructure that does the prospecting for them. While you're chasing leads manually, their systems are working round the clock.
>
> Consider this: that expensive website refresh may actually be costing you six figures annually in opportunities that never materialise."

---

### Example 3: Testimonial Presentation

**US Style:**
> "We tripled our demo bookings in 60 days. The ROI was immediate — the project paid for itself in month one."
>
> — James K., Founder, B2B SaaS Company (London)

**UK Style:**
> "The results rather exceeded our expectations. Within two months, we saw a threefold increase in qualified enquiries, and the investment returned itself within the first billing cycle."
>
> — James K., Founder, B2B Software Firm (London)

---

### Example 4: Call-to-Action

**US Style:**
> **Book Your Strategy Call**
>
> In 30 minutes, we'll diagnose exactly why your website isn't converting and map out a 90-day plan to fix it. No obligation. No pressure. Just clarity.
>
> [Schedule Now →]

**UK Style:**
> **Request a Strategy Consultation**
>
> In a focused 30-minute conversation, we'll identify the gaps in your current digital presence and outline a practical path forward. No hard sell — simply honest assessment and clear next steps.
>
> [Book Your Call →]

---

### Example 5: About / Authority Section

**US Style:**
> "I've spent 5+ years helping B2B and premium B2C businesses in the US, UK, and Canada transform their digital presence from 'just another website' into revenue-generating systems.
>
> The problem isn't your service — it's that your digital storefront doesn't match the quality you deliver in person. I fix that."

**UK Style:**
> "Over the past five years, I've worked with established B2B and premium B2C businesses across North America and the UK to align their digital presence with the quality of service they actually deliver.
>
> My approach is straightforward: if your website isn't working as hard as you are, something's fundamentally wrong with its architecture. That's what I address."
