# Variation Framework — Lucas Nogueira Brand

This document provides structured systems to generate multiple versions of content while maintaining the strategic essence of the brand. Use it to create systematic variations of hooks, scripts, and CTAs.

---

## 1. A/B Hook Framework

For each content topic, generate 3 hook versions following these structures:

### 1.1 Direct Hook (Provocative Statement)

**Structure:** Strong declaration that challenges a common belief or presents a surprising fact.

**Formula:** `[Counterintuitive statement] + [Implied consequence]`

**Examples:**

| Topic | Direct Hook |
|-------|-------------|
| Non-converting site | "Your beautiful website is actively repelling your best customers." |
| Agency cost | "That $50,000 agency just charged you for organized chaos." |
| Generic design | "Good enough design is the most expensive mistake in B2B." |
| Cheap freelancer | "The cheap freelancer isn't saving you money. He's costing you clients." |
| Digital presence | "Your digital presence is screaming 'amateur' to every premium client." |

**When to use:** Top of funnel, discovery content, first 3 seconds of Reels.

---

### 1.2 Question Hook (Challenges Beliefs)

**Structure:** Rhetorical question that makes the viewer question something they accept as truth.

**Formula:** `[Why/How/What] + [ICP situation] + [unexpected outcome]?`

**Examples:**

| Topic | Question Hook |
|-------|---------------|
| Non-converting site | "Why does your $15k website generate fewer leads than a Google Doc?" |
| Agency cost | "What if every dollar you spent on agencies was actually buying you confusion?" |
| Generic design | "How much revenue are you losing because your site looks like everyone else's?" |
| Cheap freelancer | "Why do the cheapest solutions always end up being the most expensive?" |
| Digital presence | "What's the real cost of looking small when your business is big?" |

**When to use:** Middle of funnel, educational content, feed posts.

---

### 1.3 Story Hook (Specific Scene)

**Structure:** Opens with a vivid, specific scene that the ICP immediately recognizes.

**Formula:** `[Specific moment] + [visceral emotion] + [implied tension]`

**Examples:**

| Topic | Story Hook |
|-------|------------|
| Non-converting site | "You're on a call with a dream client. They say 'I checked your website...' and your stomach drops." |
| Agency cost | "Month 4. Third revision. The designer, developer, and marketing guy still aren't aligned." |
| Generic design | "Your competitor just closed a deal you deserved. His product is worse, but his website isn't." |
| Cheap freelancer | "The Fiverr developer delivered. Three weeks later, nothing works and he's gone." |
| Digital presence | "You send your website link and immediately wish you hadn't." |

**When to use:** Any funnel stage, high-retention Reels, storytelling content.

---

### 1.4 Hook Selection Matrix

| Objective | Recommended Hook | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Maximize reach | Direct | Polarizes, generates debate |
| Generate saves | Question | Thought-provoking, perceived value |
| High retention | Story | Emotional connection |
| Quick authority | Direct | Demonstrates confidence |
| Qualified leads | Story | Filters by recognition |

---

## 2. Duration Framework

For each script, generate versions in 4 distinct durations:

### 2.1 Ultra-Short (15 seconds)

**Structure:**
```
[0-3s]  HOOK - Capture attention
[3-12s] SINGLE POINT - One idea, one phrase
[12-15s] CTA - Clear action
```

**Template:**
```
HOOK: [1-line provocative statement]

POINT: [2-3 sentence development]

CTA: [1-phrase action]
```

**Example (Topic: Strategic Digital Dissonance):**
```
HOOK: Your website looks like a Ferrari. Converts like a broken bicycle.

POINT: Beautiful design without conversion engineering is just expensive art.

CTA: Save this. Check your analytics. Then DM me "audit".
```

---

### 2.2 Short (30 seconds)

**Structure:**
```
[0-3s]   HOOK - Capture attention
[3-12s]  PROBLEM - Recognizable situation
[12-25s] SOLUTION - Concept or insight
[25-30s] CTA - Clear action
```

**Template:**
```
HOOK: [Provocative hook]

PROBLEM: [ICP situation in 2-3 sentences]

SOLUTION: [Insight or concept in 2-3 sentences]

CTA: [Specific action]
```

**Example (Topic: Strategic Digital Dissonance):**
```
HOOK: The most expensive mistake in B2B? Hiring a designer.

PROBLEM: You pay $15k for a beautiful website. Six months later: zero qualified leads. The designer delivered exactly what you asked for. That's the problem.

SOLUTION: Design without strategy is just decoration. What you need isn't a prettier site. It's a conversion system that happens to look beautiful.

CTA: Comment "system" and I'll show you the framework.
```

---

### 2.3 Standard (60 seconds)

**Structure:**
```
[0-3s]   HOOK - Capture attention
[3-15s]  PROBLEM - Detailed pain
[15-35s] INSIGHT - Mechanism explanation
[35-50s] PROOF - Credibility or example
[50-60s] CTA - Clear action
```

**Template:**
```
HOOK: [High-impact hook]

PROBLEM:
[Visceral pain in 3-4 sentences]
[Tangible consequence]

INSIGHT:
[Concept name]
[Simple language explanation]
[Why it works/doesn't work]

PROOF:
[Example, case, or credential]

CTA: [Action with clear benefit]
```

**Example (Topic: Strategic Digital Dissonance):**
```
HOOK: Your beautiful website is your most expensive liability.

PROBLEM: You invested in premium design. Paid for professional development. Hired a marketing consultant. And somehow, your site still doesn't generate qualified leads. You feel like you're missing something everyone else figured out.

INSIGHT: It's called Strategic Digital Dissonance. Your designer optimized for aesthetics. Your developer optimized for function. Your marketer optimized for traffic. Nobody optimized for conversion. Each piece is technically correct. Together, they cancel each other out.

PROOF: I've audited over 200 B2B sites. 90% have this exact problem. The fix isn't better design. It's Synchronous Conversion Architecture — one system where every element serves one goal.

CTA: Follow for the framework. Or DM "audit" for a free 15-minute tear-down.
```

---

### 2.4 Long (90 seconds)

**Structure:**
```
[0-3s]   HOOK - Capture attention
[3-15s]  BACKSTORY - Context or origin
[15-30s] PROBLEM - Detailed pain with layers
[30-55s] INSIGHT - Complete mechanism explanation
[55-75s] PROOF - Multiple credibility points
[75-90s] CTA - Action with urgency or scarcity
```

**Template:**
```
HOOK: [High-impact hook]

BACKSTORY:
[How you discovered/why it matters]

PROBLEM:
[Primary pain]
[Secondary pains]
[Real cost]

INSIGHT:
[Concept name]
[Simplified technical definition]
[Clarifying analogy]
[Why previous solutions failed]

PROOF:
[Case or number]
[Credential]
[Transformation]

CTA: [Action with urgency or proximity]
```

---

### 2.5 Duration Conversion Table

| From | To | What to Remove | What to Keep |
|------|-----|----------------|--------------|
| 90s | 60s | Backstory, secondary proofs | Hook, main insight, 1 proof |
| 60s | 30s | Proof, problem details | Hook, summarized problem, summarized insight |
| 30s | 15s | Problem explanation | Hook, 1 value sentence, CTA |
| 15s | 90s | Expand each section | Keep hook, add layers |

---

## 3. CTA Framework

For each script, generate 3 Call-to-Action intensities:

### 3.1 Soft CTA (Engagement)

**Objective:** Maximize interaction, build audience, signal interest.

**Actions:** Save, comment, share, follow.

**Formulas:**
- "Save this for your next [situation]."
- "Comment [word] if this resonates."
- "Share with a founder who needs this."
- "Follow for more [topic]."
- "Double tap if you've experienced this."

**Examples:**
| Context | Soft CTA |
|---------|----------|
| Conversion insight | "Save this. You'll need it when your site disappoints you again." |
| Common problem | "Comment 'same' if you've felt this." |
| Useful framework | "Share with a founder still fighting this battle." |
| Content series | "Follow for Part 2 — the solution." |

---

### 3.2 Medium CTA (Continuity)

**Objective:** Deepen relationship, move to next step, capture intent.

**Actions:** DM, link in bio, next part, lead magnet.

**Formulas:**
- "DM '[word]' for [specific resource]."
- "Link in bio for the full [framework/guide/checklist]."
- "Part 2 drops [day]. Turn on notifications."
- "Comment '[word]' and I'll send you [resource]."
- "Check the pinned post for [continuation]."

**Examples:**
| Context | Medium CTA |
|---------|------------|
| After insight | "DM 'audit' and I'll review your site in 15 minutes." |
| Partial framework | "Full F.O.C.O. breakdown in bio. It's free." |
| Series | "Part 2: How to fix this. Tomorrow, same time." |
| Educational value | "Comment 'framework' and I'll send the template." |

---

### 3.3 Hard CTA (Conversion)

**Objective:** Generate applications, calls, direct sales.

**Actions:** Apply, schedule, buy, start project.

**Formulas:**
- "Link in bio to apply for [offer]."
- "DM 'ready' to start your [transformation]."
- "Book your strategy call — link in bio."
- "Applications open for [month]. Spots limited."
- "[Number] spots left this month. Link in bio."

**Examples:**
| Context | Hard CTA |
|---------|----------|
| Bottom of funnel | "2 spots left for January. DM 'project' to apply." |
| After social proof | "Ready to fix this? Link in bio to book a strategy call." |
| Urgency | "I take 2 clients per month. Applications close Friday." |
| Direct | "DM 'system' and let's build yours." |

---

### 3.4 CTA Selection Matrix

| Content Type | Recommended CTA | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Discovery/Viral | Soft | Maximize reach, low friction |
| Educational | Medium | Deepen, capture interest |
| Social proof | Hard | Convert momentum |
| Series/Part 1-2 | Medium | Keep in journey |
| Storytelling | Soft or Medium | Depends on emotional connection |
| Positioning | Soft | Build authority |

---

## 4. Tone Framework

How to adapt the same content for different funnel stages:

### 4.1 Top of Funnel (Provocative)

**Characteristics:**
- Casual, bold, provocative
- Curious hooks, polarizing statements
- Focus on capturing attention and generating recognition
- Simplicity over depth

**Adjustments:**
| Element | Adjustment |
|---------|------------|
| Vocabulary | Colloquial, everyday metaphors |
| Sentences | Short, impactful |
| Emotion | Curiosity, surprise, indignation |
| Complexity | Low — 1 idea per content |
| Authority | Implied, not stated |

**Typical expressions:**
- "Here's the thing nobody tells you..."
- "Stop doing [X]. Seriously."
- "This is why [common belief] is wrong."
- "I'm going to say something controversial."

**Adaptation example:**
```
ORIGINAL: Strategic Digital Dissonance occurs when design, technology, and marketing operate in silos.

TOP OF FUNNEL: Your designer, developer, and marketer are playing different songs. That's why nobody's dancing.
```

---

### 4.2 Middle of Funnel (Educational)

**Characteristics:**
- Didactic, detailed, generous
- Multi-angle explanations
- Focus on teaching and building trust
- Depth over brevity

**Adjustments:**
| Element | Adjustment |
|---------|------------|
| Vocabulary | Precise, technical but accessible |
| Sentences | Longer, with parentheses and clarifications |
| Emotion | Trust, clarity, "aha moment" |
| Complexity | High — frameworks, steps, nuances |
| Authority | Explicit through knowledge |

**Typical expressions:**
- "In practice, what this means is..."
- "Let me break this down step by step."
- "The reason this works is..."
- "To give you more context..."
- "In other words..."

**Adaptation example:**
```
ORIGINAL: Strategic Digital Dissonance occurs when design, technology, and marketing operate in silos.

MIDDLE OF FUNNEL: Strategic Digital Dissonance — and this is the core of the problem — happens when your designer optimizes for aesthetics, your developer optimizes for functionality, and your marketer optimizes for traffic. Each one is technically correct in their approach. But the result is a system where the pieces don't serve the same goal. In practice, this means your beautiful site doesn't convert, your fast-loading pages don't communicate value, and your traffic bounces because the experience feels fragmented.
```

---

### 4.3 Bottom of Funnel (Direct)

**Characteristics:**
- Direct, results-focused
- Connects technical to business benefits
- Focus on justifying investment
- Clarity over sophistication

**Adjustments:**
| Element | Adjustment |
|---------|------------|
| Vocabulary | Results-oriented, ROI, metrics |
| Sentences | Short, declarative, confident |
| Emotion | Urgency, certainty, desire |
| Complexity | Medium — clear benefits, simple process |
| Authority | Explicit through results |

**Typical expressions:**
- "The result for your business is..."
- "In 90 days, you'll have..."
- "This translates to..."
- "That's why our method works."
- "For companies like yours, this means..."

**Adaptation example:**
```
ORIGINAL: Strategic Digital Dissonance occurs when design, technology, and marketing operate in silos.

BOTTOM OF FUNNEL: Your current setup has what I call Strategic Digital Dissonance — and it's costing you qualified leads every day. The fix is Synchronous Conversion Architecture: one integrated system where every element serves conversion. For your business, this translates to a 3-4x increase in demo bookings within 90 days. That's the difference between a website and a sales system.
```

---

### 4.4 Tone Conversion Table

| From | To | Main Adjustments |
|------|-----|------------------|
| Top to Middle | Add explanations, expand concepts, remove excessive provocation |
| Middle to Bottom | Condense, focus on benefits, add numbers and results |
| Bottom to Top | Simplify, add emotional hook, remove technical details |
| Top to Bottom | Keep energy, add proof, direct toward action |

---

**Adaptation tips:**
- Avoid excessive emojis
- Focus on business value, not aesthetics
- Use numbers and results
- Invite discussion

**LinkedIn adaptation example:**
```
Most B2B founders think their website problem is design.

It's not.

I've audited 200+ B2B sites this year. The pattern is always the same:

- Beautiful design (check)
- Fast loading (check)
- Professional copy (check)
- Zero qualified leads (also check)

The problem isn't any single element. It's what I call Strategic Digital Dissonance — when design, development, and marketing optimize for different goals.

Your designer optimizes for aesthetics.
Your developer optimizes for speed.
Your marketer optimizes for traffic.

Nobody optimizes for conversion.

The fix isn't better execution. It's better integration.

What's your biggest frustration with your current website?

5. **Carousel Adaptation:** Transform master into slides
6. **LinkedIn Adaptation:** Adjust tone and format

---

## 7. Complete Practical Example

One topic developed across all variations:

### Topic: "Your beautiful website doesn't convert (Strategic Digital Dissonance)"

---

#### 7.1 Hook Variations

**Direct Hook:**
"Your beautiful website is your most expensive liability."

**Question Hook:**
"Why does your $15k website generate fewer leads than a simple landing page?"

**Story Hook:**
"You're showing your website to an investor. Halfway through, you realize: this looks amateur. Your stomach drops."

---

#### 7.2 Duration Variations

**Ultra-Short (15s):**
```
Your website looks expensive. Converts like it's free.

Beautiful design without conversion strategy is just expensive art.

Save this. Check your bounce rate. Then DM "audit".
```

**Short (30s):**
```
Your beautiful website is your biggest liability.

You invested $15k in design. Premium photography. Clean code. Six months later: zero qualified leads.

The problem isn't the design. It's what's missing behind it — conversion architecture.

DM "system" and I'll show you the fix.
```

**Standard (60s):**
```
Your beautiful website is actively repelling your best customers.

I know that sounds backwards. You paid good money for premium design. The photos are perfect. The copy was written by a pro. So why aren't qualified leads booking calls?

It's called Strategic Digital Dissonance. Your designer optimized for aesthetics. Your developer optimized for speed. Your marketer optimized for clicks. Nobody optimized for conversion. Every piece works. Together, they fail.

I've seen this pattern in 200+ B2B audits. The fix isn't better design — it's Synchronous Conversion Architecture. One system where every element serves one goal.

Follow for the framework. Or DM "audit" for a free tear-down.
```

**Long (90s):**
```
Your beautiful website is your most expensive liability. Let me explain.

Three years ago, a SaaS founder showed me his new $30k website. Award-winning design. Lightning fast. Perfect mobile experience. In 6 months, it generated exactly 4 demo requests. Four.

His previous ugly WordPress site? 40 demos a month.

What happened?

Strategic Digital Dissonance. His designer optimized for awards. His developer optimized for performance scores. His copywriter optimized for elegance. Nobody asked: what makes someone click "Book a Demo"?

They built a Ferrari body with a bicycle engine. Beautiful. Useless.

The fix isn't better design. It's Synchronous Conversion Architecture — where every pixel, every word, every interaction serves one goal: conversion.

That founder? After we rebuilt with this approach, he hit 120 demos per month. Same traffic. Same product. Different architecture.

I take 2 clients per month. DM "system" if you're ready to fix yours.
```

---

#### 7.3 CTA Variations

**Soft:**
"Save this for your next website meeting. Share with a founder who needs to hear it."

**Medium:**
"DM 'audit' and I'll do a free 15-minute tear-down of your site. Link in bio for the full framework."

**Hard:**
"I take 2 clients per month. January has 1 spot left. DM 'project' to apply."

---

#### 7.4 Tone Variations

**Top of Funnel:**
"Your designer made it pretty. Your developer made it fast. Nobody made it convert. That's the problem."

**Middle of Funnel:**
"Strategic Digital Dissonance occurs when each specialist optimizes for their own metric — aesthetics, performance, traffic — without anyone optimizing for the metric that actually matters: conversion. In practice, this means you can have a technically flawless website that systematically fails to turn visitors into customers."

**Bottom of Funnel:**
"Your current site has Strategic Digital Dissonance. Here's what that's costing you: every 1000 visitors, you're losing 35-40 potential qualified leads to a fragmented experience. The fix takes 90 days and the ROI typically shows in month one."

---

#### 7.5 Format Variations

**Reel (30s):**
```
[Visual: Lucas pointing at screen with beautiful site]

"This $15k website generates zero leads."

[Cut to close-up]

"Beautiful design. Fast loading. Great copy. So what's broken?"

[Text on screen: "STRATEGIC DIGITAL DISSONANCE"]

"Designer optimized for aesthetics. Developer optimized for speed. Nobody optimized for conversion."

[Cut to split screen: silos vs. integrated]

"The fix isn't better design. It's better architecture."

[Final: Lucas looking at camera]

"DM 'audit' for a free tear-down."
```

**Carousel (10 slides):**
```
1. "Your $15k website is failing. Here's the real reason."
2. "It's not the design (that's beautiful)"
3. "It's not the code (that's clean)"
4. "It's not the copy (that's professional)"
5. "It's the DISSONANCE between them"
6. "Designer: optimized for aesthetics"
7. "Developer: optimized for speed"
8. "Marketer: optimized for traffic"
9. "Nobody: optimized for conversion"
10. "The fix: Synchronous Conversion Architecture. DM 'audit' for a free review."
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
Your website might be beautiful, fast, and professionally written.

And still failing to convert.

Here's what I've learned from 200+ B2B site audits this year:

The problem is rarely the individual pieces. It's what I call Strategic Digital Dissonance.

Your designer optimizes for aesthetics.
Your developer optimizes for performance.
Your copywriter optimizes for elegance.

Each one succeeds at their goal.
Together, they fail at yours: conversion.

The fix isn't hiring better specialists.
It's hiring someone who thinks about the whole system.

What's your biggest frustration with your current website?
