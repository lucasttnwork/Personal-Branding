# Building in Public: 14-Day Reels Calendar (Reframed for James)

## Strategic Realignment Summary

This calendar has been **completely reframed** to speak to James (the ICP), not to designers or DIY entrepreneurs. Every script now follows the **PAIN-PROOF-PATH** framework.

### Key Changes Made:
- **Hooks start with James's PAIN**, not with methodology
- **Language is business results**, not technical process
- **CTAs point to service**, not to "learn more"
- **Complexity is shown as REASON TO HIRE**, not tutorial to replicate

---

## Overview

A 2-week content series documenting the complete journey of building a client acquisition system — **reframed to show James what he's missing and why he needs to hire someone to fix it**.

**Target Audience:** B2B founders, SaaS executives, established local business owners (US/Canada/UK) with **$5k-$10k to invest in positioning**

**Who This Attracts:**
- James/Sarah: 38-55, CEO/Founder with budget and authority
- Someone who WANTS TO HIRE, not learn
- Premium B2B (SaaS, consulting) and B2C (clinics, law firms, restaurants)

**Who This No Longer Attracts:**
- Web designers wanting methodology
- DIY entrepreneurs who'll do it themselves
- Agencies looking for processes to copy
- Low-budget "can you just make it look nice" clients

---

## Content Framework: PAIN-PROOF-PATH

Every script follows this structure:

1. **PAIN (0-5s)** — Hook with James's specific problem
2. **PROOF (5-15s)** — "Building in public" context as expertise proof
3. **PATH (15-45s)** — Insight about what James doesn't know
4. **COST (45-55s)** — What it costs to NOT have this
5. **CTA (55-65s)** — Service-oriented, not educational

---

## Week 1: Why Your Site Isn't Working

**Narrative Arc:** Expose the hidden reasons beautiful sites don't convert — problems James has but hasn't diagnosed.

---

### Day 1 - Monday

**Theme:** "Why I'm Rebuilding My Site (And Why You Should Worry About Yours)"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Roteiro_Viral_Building_in_Public_Day_1.md`

**Key Message:** If a web consultant is rebuilding HIS OWN site, maybe James's site needs work too.

**Duration:** 60s

---

### Day 2 - Tuesday

**Theme:** "Why Your Site Talks to Everyone and Sells to No One"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_2_ICP.md`

**Hook:** "Your site says 'We help businesses grow.' So does everyone else's."

**Key Insight:** Generic messaging = generic results. James's site doesn't speak to anyone specifically.

**Duration:** 60s

---

### Day 3 - Wednesday

**Theme:** "The Hidden Objections Killing Your Conversions"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_3_Journey.md`

**Hook:** "In the first 10 seconds on your site, your visitor thinks 'Can I trust this?' Do you answer that?"

**Key Insight:** Visitors have objections at every moment. If you're not answering them in real-time, you're losing them.

**Duration:** 65s

---

### Day 4 - Thursday

**Theme:** "You Have Testimonials. They're in the Wrong Place."

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_4_Triggers.md`

**Hook:** "You added testimonials to your site. Great. But are they placed where skepticism peaks?"

**Key Insight:** PLACEMENT matters more than existence. James has the elements but they're not strategically positioned.

**Duration:** 60s

---

### Day 5 - Friday

**Theme:** "This Blueprint Took 5 Days. Skipping It Will Cost You 5 Months."

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_5_Blueprint.md`

**Hook:** "Most business owners skip this phase entirely. Then they spend 6 months wondering why their expensive site doesn't generate leads."

**Key Insight:** The strategic work most skip is WHY redesigns fail. The complexity shown justifies hiring.

**Duration:** 55s

---

### Day 6 - Saturday

**Theme:** "Why Your 'Pretty' Site Doesn't Convert"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_6_Wireframe.md`

**Hook:** "Your designer made something beautiful. Did they map how your visitor's eye should travel?"

**Key Insight:** Pretty ≠ strategic. Structure determines conversion, not aesthetics.

**Duration:** 65s

---

### Day 7 - Sunday

**Theme:** "Your Headline Is About You. That's Why It Doesn't Work."

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_7_Copy.md`

**Hook:** "'We are a leading provider of solutions.' That's your headline? That's why visitors leave in 3 seconds."

**Key Insight:** Headlines that talk about the company (not the client's pain) fail immediately.

**Duration:** 65s

---

## Week 2: What Premium Actually Looks Like

**Narrative Arc:** Show what James is missing — and why it requires expertise to build.

---

### Day 8 - Monday

**Theme:** "Colors Aren't Decoration. They're Sales Psychology."

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_8_Design.md`

**Hook:** "You picked blue because you like blue. But does blue make your ideal client trust you?"

**Key Insight:** Colors communicate before words. Random choices send random signals.

**Duration:** 65s

---

### Day 9 - Tuesday

**Theme:** "Every Element Has a Job. Does Yours?"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_9_Homepage.md`

**Hook:** "This button is here for a reason. This testimonial is placed at this exact moment for a reason. Can you say the same about your site?"

**Key Insight:** Random sections = random results. Every element needs a strategic JOB.

**Duration:** 70s

---

### Day 10 - Wednesday

**Theme:** "Why Your Site Came Back Looking Different Than the Design"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_10_Handoff.md`

**Hook:** "You approved a beautiful design. Then the developer 'interpreted' it. Sound familiar?"

**Key Insight:** Designer/developer separation = compromise. One team = consistency.

**Duration:** 60s

---

### Day 11 - Thursday

**Theme:** "Your Slow Site Is Costing You 7% Per Second"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_11_Frontend.md`

**Hook:** "For every second your site takes to load, you lose 7% of conversions."

**Key Insight:** Speed is a conversion factor. Same design, different technical execution = different results.

**Duration:** 65s

---

### Day 12 - Friday

**Theme:** "60% of Your B2B Prospects See THIS First"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_12_Mobile.md`

**Hook:** "Your ideal client is a CEO. You think she's on desktop? She's on her phone."

**Key Insight:** B2B = mobile first. "Responsive" isn't enough — mobile-optimized is required.

**Duration:** 60s

---

### Day 13 - Saturday

**Theme:** "A Beautiful Site Is Still Just a Brochure"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_13_Deploy.md`

**Hook:** "Congratulations. Your site is live. It's still just a digital brochure."

**Key Insight:** Live ≠ working. Without automation, a site just exists — it doesn't generate.

**Duration:** 55s

---

### Day 14 - Sunday (FINALE)

**Theme:** "This Is What Working While You Sleep Actually Looks Like"

**Script:** `Roteiros-Reels/Building_in_Public_Day_14_Automation.md`

**Hook:** "I woke up to 3 qualified leads in my CRM. No cold outreach. No manual work."

**Key Insight:** Automation is the difference between website and SYSTEM. This is what James actually wants.

**Duration:** 75s

---

## Production Guidelines (Updated)

### Voice & Tone for James
- **Consultant, not teacher:** "Here's what most businesses miss" not "Let me show you how"
- **Empathetic to pain:** Acknowledge James has tried and been disappointed
- **Confident in diagnosis:** Clear about what's wrong without being arrogant

### Vocabulary Guidelines

**AVOID (Technical/Designer Language):**
- Wireframe, low-fidelity, information architecture
- Customer journey mapping, conversion triggers
- PAS framework, AIDA model, ICP definition
- Lazy loading, breakpoints, CI/CD
- Zapier, Make, CRM integration

**USE (Business Results Language):**
- Leads, conversions, qualified prospects
- Works while you sleep, generates automatically
- Structure, flow, what visitors experience
- First impressions, trust signals
- System vs. brochure

### CTA Guidelines

Every CTA should point toward SERVICE, not education:

**AVOID:**
- "Follow to learn more"
- "Here's how you can do this too"
- "Try this on your own site"

**USE:**
- "Link in bio if you want this done for your business"
- "DM me for an audit"
- "This is what we build for clients"

---

## Success Metrics (Reframed)

### RIGHT Metrics (Indicate James):
- **DMs asking about services:** "How much does this cost?"
- **Comments like "I need this":** Pain is resonating
- **Link clicks to booking calendar:** Intent to buy
- **Profile visits → follow → link click:** Qualification path

### WRONG Metrics (Indicate designers/devs):
- **Technical questions:** "What tool do you use?"
- **Saves for "doing later":** DIY intent
- **Comments from other professionals:** "Great methodology!"
- **Questions about process:** "Can you break this down more?"

## Final Alignment Checklist

Every script should pass these checks:

- [ ] Hook speaks to James's PAIN, not methodology?
- [ ] Vocabulary is business results, not technical process?
- [ ] James thinks "I need to hire this guy" not "I'll try this myself"?
- [ ] CTA directs to service, not to "learn more"?
- [ ] Complexity demonstrated is REASON to hire, not tutorial to replicate?
- [ ] Uses language from DNA_Business/Publico.md (James's fears, desires)?

---

**This calendar now aligns completely with the ICP strategy. Every piece of content speaks DIRECTLY to James — the premium client who wants to HIRE, not learn.**
