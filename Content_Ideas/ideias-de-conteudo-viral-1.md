# 15 Instagram Reels Ideas — Building in Public Series

## REEL 1 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Your B2B website looks professional but generates zero leads. Here's why."

**Core Message:** Most B2B founders invest in beautiful websites that impress visually but fail strategically. The real bottleneck? Strategic Digital Dissonance — when design, tech, and sales strategy don't speak the same language.

**Visual Concept:** Split screen showing a sleek website on one side, empty CRM dashboard on the other. Text overlay: "Beautiful ≠ Profitable"

**CTA:** "Building my agency's conversion system from scratch. Follow to see how I fix this for my own business first."

**Duration:** 45 seconds

---

## REEL 2 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Why hiring a designer AND a developer separately is setting you up for failure"

**Core Message:** The fragmented agency model forces you to be the project manager connecting specialists who don't communicate. You end up with a Ferrari body on a Beetle engine — looks good, doesn't perform.

**Visual Concept:** Show three separate puzzle pieces (Designer, Developer, Marketer) that don't fit together. Then show one integrated piece labeled "Conversion System."

**CTA:** "Day 3 of building my own system. Watch me avoid this exact mistake."

**Duration:** 35 seconds

---

## REEL 3 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Your website is an orchestra where everyone plays a different song"

**Core Message:** The designer creates beauty. The developer builds functionality. The marketer drives traffic. But without a unified strategy (the conductor), it's just noise that repels premium clients instead of attracting them.

**Visual Concept:** Orchestra metaphor with visual chaos turning into harmony when a conductor (strategy) appears.

**CTA:** "This is why I'm documenting my entire build process. Link in bio for the full breakdown."

**Duration:** 50 seconds

---

## REEL 4 — Consideration Stage

**Hook:** "Building my agency website: Day 1 — The Foundation phase you can't skip"

**Core Message:** Before touching design or code, I'm mapping my ideal client journey, conversion triggers, and strategic positioning. This blueprint determines if the system will generate $5k or $50k in its first 90 days.

**Visual Concept:** Screen recording of strategy session with Miro/Figma board, showing ICP definition and customer journey mapping.

**CTA:** "This is the F.O.C.O. Method I use for $30k+ clients. Now applying it to myself."

**Duration:** 60 seconds

---

## REEL 5 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Stop measuring website success by traffic. Start measuring by qualified demos booked."

**Core Message:** Vanity metrics like page views mean nothing if they don't convert to revenue. For B2B high-ticket, the only metric that matters is Sales Qualified Leads generated per month.

**Visual Concept:** Dashboard showing high traffic numbers with red X, then low traffic with high conversion rate with green checkmark.

**CTA:** "Follow the build. I'm tracking real conversion metrics weekly."

**Duration:** 40 seconds

---

## REEL 6 — Consideration Stage

**Hook:** "Day 7: Creating the wireframes that will turn visitors into booked demos"

**Core Message:** This isn't about making things "pretty." Every section, every button placement, every word is engineered for one outcome: moving the ideal client from curiosity to conversion. This is Synchronous Conversion Architecture in action.

**Visual Concept:** Screen recording of Figma wireframes with annotations explaining the strategic reasoning behind each design decision.

**CTA:** "This is the Orchestration phase. Design meets psychology."

**Duration:** 75 seconds

---

## REEL 7 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Losing just ONE $15k client per quarter because of an amateur website costs you $60k/year"

**Core Message:** Most B2B founders don't realize the real cost of inaction. That outdated site isn't just "not helping" — it's actively costing you six figures in lost opportunities with clients who judge your capability by your digital presence.

**Visual Concept:** Calculator animation showing the math: 1 lost client × $15k × 4 quarters = $60k annual loss.

**CTA:** "I'm investing $10k in my own system. Here's why it's worth it."

**Duration:** 45 seconds

---

## REEL 8 — Consideration Stage

**Hook:** "Behind the scenes: The tech stack I'm using to build a $30k conversion system"

**Core Message:** Walk through the specific tools and technologies being implemented — from frontend framework to automation platforms. This transparency shows the depth of execution and educates the audience on what "premium" actually means.

**Visual Concept:** Clean motion graphics showing the tech stack layers with brief explanations of each component's role.

**CTA:** "Day 12 of the build. Construction phase is where strategy becomes reality."

**Duration:** 55 seconds

---

## REEL 9 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Your site looks professional but feels... off. Here's the hidden problem."

**Core Message:** Strategic Digital Dissonance happens when your messaging, visual identity, and user experience aren't aligned with your actual market positioning. You say premium, but your site screams template. That disconnect kills trust instantly.

**Visual Concept:** Before/after comparison showing subtle but crucial differences in positioning through design and copy.

**CTA:** "Fixing this exact issue in my own build. Follow for the breakdown."

**Duration:** 40 seconds

---

## REEL 10 — Conversion Stage

**Hook:** "Why I offer a 90-day performance guarantee (and why most agencies can't)"

**Core Message:** Most agencies can't guarantee results because they deliver disconnected pieces. When you build with Synchronous Conversion Architecture — strategy, design, and tech unified from day one — the outcome becomes predictable. That's why I can put my money where my mouth is.

**Visual Concept:** Direct-to-camera explanation with text overlays highlighting the guarantee terms and what makes it possible.

**CTA:** "Opening 2 spots for March. DM 'BUILD' if you want this for your business."

**Duration:** 50 seconds

---

## REEL 11 — Consideration Stage

**Hook:** "Day 15: Setting up the automation that will capture leads while I sleep"

**Core Message:** The Operation phase is where the system becomes autonomous. Email sequences, CRM integration, demo booking automation — this is what separates a static website from a 24/7 sales machine.

**Visual Concept:** Screen recording of automation setup with workflow diagrams showing the lead nurture sequence.

**CTA:** "This is the final F.O.C.O. phase. The system is almost live."

**Duration:** 65 seconds

---

## REEL 12 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "The real reason your landing page converts at 1% instead of 5%"

**Core Message:** It's not your offer. It's not your traffic quality. It's the 47 micro-disconnects between what your visitor expects and what your page delivers. Every misaligned headline, confusing CTA, and slow-loading section bleeds conversions.

**Visual Concept:** Annotated landing page teardown showing specific conversion killers with percentage impact.

**CTA:** "I found 12 of these in my own draft. Fixing them live in the build series."

**Duration:** 50 seconds

---

## REEL 13 — Conversion Stage

**Hook:** "What I learned spending $10k on my own website (so you don't waste yours)"

**Core Message:** Recap the biggest insights from the building process — the mistakes caught, the strategic pivots, the technical decisions that matter. Position this investment as proof of commitment and expertise, not just talk.

**Visual Concept:** Fast-paced montage of key moments from the build with lessons learned as text overlays.

**CTA:** "If you want this level of strategic execution for your business, link in bio."

**Duration:** 60 seconds

---

## REEL 14 — Discovery Stage

**Hook:** "Beautiful websites don't sell. Here's the analogy that changed everything for me."

**Core Message:** A Ferrari with a Beetle engine looks incredible in the showroom but fails on the track. Your website is the same — premium appearance means nothing without the integrated engineering (strategy + design + tech) to deliver performance.

**Visual Concept:** Car analogy brought to life with simple but effective visuals showing the mismatch and then the solution.

**CTA:** "This is why I built my system differently. See the full process in my highlights."

**Duration:** 45 seconds

---

## REEL 15 — Consideration Stage

**Hook:** "The difference between a $3k website and a $30k conversion system"

**Core Message:** One is a collection of pages. The other is a strategic asset engineered to attract, qualify, and convert your ideal client predictably. The price difference isn't about complexity — it's about business impact and ROI.

**Visual Concept:** Side-by-side comparison showing surface similarities but fundamental strategic differences in approach and outcome.

**CTA:** "My system goes live next week. Follow to see the real results."

**Duration:** 55 seconds

---

## Strategic Notes for Execution

**Posting Rhythm:** 3 Reels per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to maintain consistent momentum without overwhelming production capacity.
