## Full Script

**[0:00-0:03 | VPB1]**
🎦 *Camera inside laptop half-closed. You open it like a "reveal".*
🟨 TEXT: "Pretty ≠ Trusted"
🔊 SFX: *Laptop "click"*
🗣 "Alright—here's the uncomfortable truth: a beautiful website can still make you look… small."

**[0:04-0:12]**
🎦 *Cut to you holding two cards: "DESIGN" vs "SYSTEM"*
🟨 TEXT: "You don't need a redesign. You need alignment."
🗣 "In general, founders think the fix is 'a better designer'… or 'more traffic'. But if your site isn't a **system**, you'll keep burning money."

**[0:13-0:23 | VPB2]**
🎦 *You pour water into a fancy cup with a hole (leaks).*
🟨 TEXT: "Traffic leaks = bad conversion architecture"
🗣 "If your paid traffic is landing on a page that doesn't qualify or convert… you're basically pouring water into a cup with a hole."

**[0:24-0:45 | The 20-second test]**
🎦 *Rapid jump cuts; each question pops on-screen.*
🟨 TEXT (1): "1) Who is this for?"
🗣 "Test #1: In three seconds, can I tell **who** you're for?"
🟨 TEXT (2): "2) What happens next?"
🗣 "Test #2: Is the next step obvious—book a call, request a demo, apply?"
🟨 TEXT (3): "3) Do I feel 'premium'?"
🗣 "Test #3: Does it *feel* like a premium business… or like a template with your logo slapped on?"

**[0:46-0:55 | VPB3]**
🎦 *Split-screen: left "template site"; right "clean premium layout" (you mimic with printed screenshots).*
🟨 TEXT: "Strategic Digital Dissonance"
🗣 "When those don't match, you get what I call **strategic digital dissonance**—you're great offline, but online you look… questionable."

**[0:56-1:05 | VPB4 + Soft CTA + Loop]**
🎦 *You place a sticky note on camera lens: "SYNC"*
🟨 TEXT: "Comment 'SYNC'"
🗣 "If you want, comment **SYNC** and I'll send you my checklist to fix it. Because your website isn't supposed to be pretty… it's supposed to **qualify**."
✂️ *Hard cut back to first frame (loop feel).*
