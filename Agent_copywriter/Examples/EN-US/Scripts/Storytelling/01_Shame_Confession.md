## Full Script

**[0:00-0:04 | VPB1]**
🎦 *Close on your thumb hovering over "Send" on a text message. You freeze.*
🟨 TEXT: "He didn't send it."
🔊 SFX: *message "whoosh" cuts off*
🗣 "I was on a call with a founder—great product, real traction—and then it happened."

**[0:05-0:18 | Backstory]**
🎦 *You step back, calmer, conversational*
🗣 "We're talking about a big opportunity… and I say, 'Cool, just send them your website.' (Simple, right?) He pauses. Like… a long pause."

**[0:19-0:28 | VPB2 — The Moment]**
🎦 *You hold up a printed homepage screenshot labeled "OLD SITE".*
🟨 TEXT: "Awkward silence"
🗣 "And he goes, 'Honestly… I'd rather explain it on a call. The site doesn't reflect us.'"

**[0:29-0:45 | Breaking Point]**
🎦 *Hard cut. You draw three circles on a whiteboard: Strategy / Design / Tech.*
🟨 TEXT: "The real issue: misalignment."
🗣 "That's when it clicked: the problem isn't 'we need a prettier site.' The problem is **misalignment**—strategy says premium, design says generic, tech says 'barely holding.'"

**[0:46-1:08 | Takeaway: The 3-Part Fix]**
🎦 *Each circle gets connected with a line: "sync"*
🗨️ "So we built a system where everything moves in sync—what I call a **synchronous conversion architecture**. In practice: one message, one journey, one next step."
🟨 TEXT: "FOCO: Foundation → Orchestration → Build → Operate"
🗣 "Foundation: positioning. Orchestration: user journey. Build: performance + frontend. Operate: automation that qualifies leads."

**[1:09-1:20 | VPB3 + Soft CTA]**
🎦 *You hold a sticky note: "Would you send your link?"*
🗣 "So here's my question: would you confidently text your website link to your best prospect… right now?"
🟨 TEXT: "If not, that's the signal."
🗣 "If the answer is 'eh…' — you don't have a design problem. You have a system problem."
**CTA:** "Comment **LINK** and I'll send the exact audit I use."
